    "content": "The 7 Steps of Tequila Making\nWritten on September 7, 2012\nWarning:  Division by zero in /data/26/2/11/13/2500176/user/2738275/htdocs/blog/wp-includes/functions.php on line 4239\nEver wonder how IZKALI tequila is made? We’ve got the answers for you!\nTrue tequila is made from blue agave, a succulent plant found in Mexican regions. The production of tequila is divided into seven steps: harvesting, cooking, fermentation, distillation, aging and bottling.  Every step is regulated by the Consejo Regulador de Tequila, ensuring that general guidelines are followed to guarantee maximum quality. Each distillery has its own source of agave, processes, quality control and techniques that will affect each tequila’s taste.\nStep 1 – Harvesting\nThe planting, tending and harvesting of the agave plant remains a manual effort that relies on centuries-old know how that has been passed down from generation to generation. The agave used in IZKALI’s tequila is grown in the distillery’s own fields which have been cultivated for three generations. The plants grow in neat rows for six to ten years and are meticulously tended until they are ripe and ready to harvest.\nThe harvester, or “Jimador” removes the agave leaves with a sharp curved tool called a Coa. He trims the 200 plus leaves that protect the heart or piña of the agave until the whole heart is extracted from the ground. Only the heart, or “piña,” of the agave plant is used to make tequila. Mature piñas weigh in between a hefty eighty and three hundred pounds; however, the size of the agave heart is not nearly as important as its sugar content. The older the agave, the longer the piña will have to accumulate the starches that will convert into fermentable sugars. Approximately, 15 pounds of agave piñas are required to produce one liter of delicious tequila.\nStep 2 – Cooking\nDuring this step, steam injection within traditional brick ovens or stainless steel autoclaves is used to activate a chemical process within the piña that converts complex carbohydrates into simple fermentable sugars. Cooking also softens the piña, making the process of sugar extraction easier.\nStep 3 – Extraction\nOnce cooked, the agave heads are transported to a milling area for sugar extraction. The cooked piñas are crushed in order to release the juice, or “aguamiel,” that will be fermented. The traditional method is to crush the piñas with a “tahona,” a giant grinding wheel operated by mules, oxen or tractors within a circular pit. Modern distilleries now use a mechanical crusher to separate the fiber from the juices. Once the piñas are minced they are washed with water and strained to remove the juices.\nStep 4 – Fermentation\nDuring the fermentation process the sugars are transformed into alcohol within large wooden vats or stainless steel tanks. Yeast may be added to accelerate and control the fermentation. Traditionally, the yeast that grows naturally on the agave leaves is used; however, today many distilleries use a cultivated form of wild yeast. Fermentation typically takes seven to twelve days, depending on the method used.\nStep 5 – Distillation\nThe fifth step of creating tequila is distillation, in which ferments are separated by heat and steam pressure within stainless steel pot stills or distillation towers. While some tequilas are distilled three times, the majority are only distilled twice, including IZKALI Tequila. The first distillation, also known as “deztrozamiento” or “smashing,” takes a couple hours and yields a liquid with an alcohol level of about 20% known as “ordinario.” The second distillation, known as “rectification,” takes three to four hours and yields a liquid with an alcohol level near 55%. After the second distillation the tequila is considered silver, or “blanco,” tequila.\nStep 6 – Aging\nAlmost all containers used in tequila aging are French or American white oak barrels that have previously been used to age bourbon. Reposados are aged between two and twelve months, Añejos are aged between one and three years and Extra Añejos are aged for over three years. The longer the tequila ages, the more color and tannins the final product will have. The condition of the barrels (such as their age, previous use and if their interiors have been burnt or toasted) will also affect the tequila’s taste.\nStep 7 – Bottling\nLike champagne, tequila is assigned an Appelation of Origin status, which limits production to five Mexican states: Guanajuato, Jalisco, Michoacán, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas. The state of Jalisco is very proud to be the center of Tequila production.  It is the only state that as a whole has the status of Appellation of Origin.  It is considered the place where tequila was first made and where the standards are defined.  The other states are only permitted to grow Blue Agave in small and defined regions. All 100% agave tequilas must be bottled in the designated Mexican regions and must bear on their labels “Hecho en Mexico / Made in Mexico.” Non-100% agave tequila, or “mixtos,” can be sold and bottled anywhere throughout the world.\nThe combination of many factors—both environmental and human—that take place within each of the seven steps give each brand of tequila its unique taste. IZKALI works closely with its distillery for its delicious and distinctive flavor."

    "content": "In Search of the Blue Agave: Making your own Tequila\nMaking your own tequila\n \nEvery    month I get two or three emails or requests on the forum for advice on    how to make tequila, usually from someone who wants to grow a few blue    agave around the house and make their own alcohol in their basement or garage. Every    month I try to explain to these writers the basics of tequila    production, the nature of the denomination of origin and some elements    about spirit production. Here are all those questions answered on a    single page.\n \nFirst, you can make your own tequila, but there are three    essential requirements you must meet:\n \nYour blue agave is grown in one of the five states of Mexico     proscribed by Mexican law.\nYour operation is located in one of those five states.\nYou have all the approvals and certificates from the Tequila     Regulatory Council and have passed all their inspections.\n \nSince tequila is a Mexican product, nothing made outside the designated    areas can be legally called tequila in any country that is either a    member of the World Trade Organization, NAFTA, or has signed any of the    other international trade agreements.\n \nIf you don't meet these three requirements, you cannot make tequila.    Period.\n \nThat has not stopped companies from producing blue agave spirits,    however. They cannot be called tequila or even use any name that    suggests tequila or the Mexican government will appeal to the federal    government in your country and start legal action against you (as J. B.    Waggoner found out with his Tequemila agave spirit). Blue agave spirits    or agave elixirs made outside Mexico - or even made within Mexico but    simply not labelled as tequila - are available on the market today.\n \nYou cannot call the product mezcal, either, because it is also protected    by a similar denomination of origin.\n \nThe other consideration is that making any distilled spirit may be    subject to stringent federal laws, and require both local registration    and approval. While making beer and wine at home may be legal and    unlicensed, generally making distilled spirits isn't.\n \nGovernments collect taxes on distilled spirits and take a dim view of    anyone who makes spirits without paying those taxes. Typically half the    cost of a bottle of spirits is taxes, so it's a big source of    governmental revenue. A licence is required in most countries - Canada    and the USA in particular - to distill alcohol, so the government can be    sure to collect those taxes. That doesn't mean you can't do it, but that    you must comply with your national regulations to do so.\n \nAnother issue is that distillation requires the proper equipment, which    can prove rather expensive to the home distiller. And even with that    equipment, it can still be dangerous. Alcohol is very volatile and    flammable. You have to exercise caution and skill when distilling.    Again, doesn't mean you can't do it with inferior or inexpensive    equipment, but your results will only be as good as the tools you used    to make them. The initial investment in good equipment often deters    'craft' distillers.\n \nUnlike many spirits where you can work from beer, sugar or molasses,    tequila has a more involved process because the raw materials are not    ready to use right from the fields. You have to figure out a way to cook    or roast the agave heads in order to turn the starches into fermentable    sugars. A home oven will only it one or perhaps two split agave heads at    best, and you will have to cook them for at least 24 hours, tying up    your oven all that time. You could, of course, build a larger oven, or    even buy a commercial oven to cook more agave at once. But again the    cost will deter most individuals.\n \nAnd even if you do all this, are you sophisticated enough to know how    and when to separate the heads and tails from the corazon of the    distillate? That's a skill that takes years to acquire.\n \nA final concern is the time it takes to produce tequila. The blue agave    takes eight to ten years to mature, but may take longer in different    climates outside its native growing region. Even if you meet all the    regulatory and safety requirements, and you still want to make your own    blue agave spirits, you won't start to see production for at least seven    years, assuming you planted the typical one-year-old shoot.\n \nAnd, of course, you have to ask yourself from where you will get those agave    shoots, enough to grow a sufficient quantity to make production    worthwhile. Many tequila producers will not sell you the shoots simply    because they don't want to encourage competition outside their own    borders. However, agave growers may do so because they have a glut of    plants and may look to any source of income from them - but you would    have to be on site to be sure you are not being sold weak or diseased    shoots. You would also have to be sure your local environment met all    the agave's needs for rainfall, nutrition and climate. If not, they may    not grow as expected, and may require watering or fertilizing.\n \nSo while it is possible to make an agave spirit, the time, expense and    effort is probably not worth it for most individuals. Better to spend    your money on tequilas from companies who already produce quality    tequila. And perhaps invest in a trip to Guadalajara where you can visit    the tequila producers and the fields to really appreciate the amount of    time and effort that goes into the making of the spirit."

The text reads: “Success four flights this morning all against twenty one mile wind started from Level with engine power alone average speed through air thirty one miles longest 57 seconds inform Press home Christmas”. The Wright brothers ran a shop in Dayton, Ohio, where they rented, sold, and manufactured bicycles. Their father, the Most Reverend Milton Wright, was a bishop in the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, whose gift of a toy “helicopter” to his sons in 1878, when Orville was seven years old and Wilbur aged eleven, has been credited with helping to kindle in them their fascination with mechanical flight. The brothers chose Kitty Hawk as the location of the first flight based on information provided by the Weather Bureau in Washington, DC."

    "content": "The Wright Brothers - First Flight, 1903\nFirst Flight, 1903\nOn December 17, 1903, Orville Wright piloted the first powered airplane 20 feet above a wind-swept beach in North Carolina. The flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet. Three more flights were made that day with\nWilbur flies a glider in earlier tests\nKitty Hawk, Oct. 10, 1902.\nOrville's brother Wilbur piloting the record flight lasting 59 seconds over a distance of 852 feet.\nThe brothers began their experimentation in flight in 1896 at their bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. They selected the beach at Kitty Hawk as their proving ground because of the constant wind that added lift to their craft. In 1902 they came to the beach with their glider and made more than 700 successful flights.\nHaving perfected glided flight, the next step was to move to powered flight. No automobile manufacturer could supply an engine both light enough and powerful enough for their needs. So they designed and built their own. All of their hard work, experimentation and innovation came together that December day as they took to the sky and forever changed the course of history. The brothers notified several newspapers prior to their historic flight, but only one - the local journal - made mention of the event.\n\"I found the control of the front rudder quite difficult\"\nThe conditions on the morning of December 17 were perfect for flight - high, consistent winds blowing from the north. At about 10:30 that morning, Orville Wright lay down on the plane's wing surface and brought its engine to life in preparation of launching it and himself into history. His diary tells the story:\nADVERTISMENT\n\"When we got up, a wind of between 20 and 25 miles was blowing from the north.\nWe got the machine out early and put out the signal for the men at the station. Before we were quite ready, John T. Daniels, W. S. Dough, A. D. Etheridge, W. C. Brinkley of Manteo, and Johnny Moore of Nags Head arrived.\nAfter running the engine and propellers a few minutes to get them in working order, I got on the machine at 10:35 for the first trial. The wind, according to our anemometers at this time, was blowing a little over 20 miles (corrected) 27 miles according to the Government anemometer at Kitty Hawk. On slipping the rope the machine started off increasing in speed to probably 7 or 8 miles. The machine lifted from the truck just as it was entering on the fourth rail. Mr. Daniels took a picture just as it left the tracks.\nI found the control of the front rudder quite difficult on account of its being balanced too near the center and thus had a tendency to turn itself when started so that the rudder was turned too far on one side and then too far on the other. As a result the machine would rise suddenly to about 10 ft. and then as suddenly, on turning the rudder, dart for the ground. A sudden dart when out about 100 feet from the end of the tracks ended the flight. Time about 12 seconds (not known exactly as watch was not promptly stopped). The lever for throwing off the engine was broken, and the skid under the rudder cracked. After repairs, at 20 min. after 11 o'clock Will made the second trial.\nThe course was about like mine, up and down but a little longer over the ground though about the same in time. Dist. not measured but about 175 ft. Wind speed not quite so strong.\nWilbur looks on as Orville pilots\nthe first powered flight\nWith the aid of the station men present, we picked the machine up and carried it back to the starting ways. At about 20 minutes till 12 o'clock I made the third trial. When out about the same distance as Will's, I met with a strong gust from the left which raised the left wing and sidled the machine off to the right in a lively manner. I immediately turned the rudder to bring the machine down and then worked the end control. Much to our surprise, on reaching the ground the left wing struck first, showing the lateral control of this machine much more effective than on any of our former ones. At the time of its sidling it had raised to a height of probably 12 to 14 feet.\nAt just 12 o'clock Will started on the fourth and last trip. The machine started off with its ups and downs as it had before, but by the time he had gone over three or four hundred feet he had it under much better control, and was traveling on a fairly even course. It proceeded in this manner till it reached a small hummock out about 800 feet from the starting ways, when it began its pitching again and suddenly darted into the ground.\nThe front rudder frame was badly broken up, but the main frame suffered none at all. The distance over the ground was 852 feet in 59 seconds. The engine turns was 1071, but this included several seconds while on the starting ways and probably about a half second after landing. The jar of landing had set the watch on machine back so that we have no exact record for the 1071 turns. Will took a picture of my third flight just before the gust struck the machine.\nThe machine left the ways successfully at every trial, and the tail was never caught by the truck as we had feared.\nAfter removing the front rudder, we carried the machine back to camp. We set the machine down a few feet west of the building, and while standing about discussing the last flight, a sudden gust of wind struck the machine and started to turn it over. All rushed to stop it. Will who was near one end ran to the front, but too late to do any good. Mr. Daniels and myself seized spars at the rear, but to no purpose. The machine gradually turned over on us. Mr. Daniels, having had no experience in handling a machine of this kind, hung on to it from the inside, and as a result was knocked down and turned over and over with it as it went. His escape was miraculous, as he was in with the engine and chains. The engine legs were all broken off, the chain guides badly bent, a number of uprights, and nearly all the rear ends of the ribs were broken. One spar only was broken.\nAfter dinner we went to Kitty Hawk to send off telegram to M.W. While there we called on Capt. and Mrs. Hobbs, Dr. Cogswell and the station men.\"\nReferences:\n   Orville Wright's diary appears in: McFarland, Marvin, The Papers of Wilbur & Orville Wright (2001); Crouch, Tom D., The Bishop's Boys: A Life of Wilbur and Orville Wright (1989); Wright, Orville, How We Invented the Airplane (1953).\nHow To Cite This Article:\n\"The Wright Brothers - First Flight, 1903\", EyeWitness to History, www.eyewitnesstohistory.com (2003).\nBoth brothers were eager to pilot the first flight.

    "content": "Wrights’ First Flight Distorted by Press\nWrights’ First Flight Distorted by Press\nby Dr. Richard Stimson\nin Inventing The Airplane\nThe age of flight dawned on the morning of December 17, 1903 at Kitty Hawk, NC when the Wright Brothers’ engine-driven heavier-than-air Flyer lifted into the air and traveled 120 feet in 12 seconds. It was an extraordinary moment. The way that the press handled the event was far less than extraordinary.\nThat afternoon, after eating a leisurely lunch, the brothers set out about 2 o’clock to walk the four miles to the weather station office in Kitty Hawk. They sent a telegram of their success to their 74-year-old father in Dayton, Ohio. Three months earlier, while seeing his sons off in Dayton, Bishop Wright had given them a dollar to cover the cost of sending a telegram as soon as they made a successful flight. Now was the time.\nThere was no Western Union in Kitty Hawk, but Jim Dosher at the weather station had agreed to communicate with the weather bureau office in Norfolk who in turn would contact Western Union.\nDosher, however, was unable to deliver the news because of a break in the telegraph line. He telephoned Alpheus Drinkwater at another location on the Outer Banks who transmitted the coded message of the Wright Brothers’ successful flight to Norfolk. Drinkwater later said he was bit annoyed that he had to relay a few unimportant telegrams to the mainland.\n(Note: The accuracy of the last paragraph involving the role of Drinkwater is in some dispute among historians. On the occasion of the dedication of the Wright Memorial in 1932, Orville Wright was asked who sent the first message – Drinkwater or Dozier? Orville stated: “The first message was sent by W. J. Dozier.” – News and Observer, Nov. 20, 1932 )\nOrville wrote the message that was sent as follows:\n“Success four flights Thursday morning all against twenty one mile wind started from level with engine power alone average speed through air thirty one miles longest 57 seconds inform press home Christmas. Orvevelle Wright”\nAn error in transmission cut two seconds off the longest flight time of 59 seconds and Orville’s name was misspelled. The wind speed of 21 mph is confusing. What Orville meant to say is that the wind was at least 21 mph during each of the four flights. The first successful flight was against a 27-mph wind.\nThe Norfolk operator sent a return message asking if he could share the news with a reporter at the “Norfolk Virginian-Pilot.” The Wrights gave an emphatic no! They wanted the first news of the event to be from Dayton.\nThe Norfolk operator, Jim Gray, ignored the negative answer and provided the information to a friend, H. P. Moore, at the paper. Having little information other than that provided in the telegram, the “Virginian-Pilot” fabricated a fanciful and inaccurate story that was published the next morning with the headline:\n“Flying Machine Soars 3 Miles in Teeth of High Wind Over Sand Hills and Waves at Kitty Hawk on Carolina Coast.”\nThey also offered the story to the Associated Press (AP) and when they declined the story, offered the story to twenty-one newspapers.\nMeanwhile Orville’s telegram arrived at 5:25 that evening. The Wrights’ father, Milton Wright, instructed daughter Katharine to walk over to her brother Lorin’s house and ask him to take the telegram to the local newspaper office for publication.\nLorin went downtown to the offices of the “Dayton Journal” and spoke to Frank Tunison, local representative of the Associated Press. Tunison was unimpressed with the telegram saying, “If it had been 57 minutes then it might have been a news item.”\nTwo other Dayton papers did publish an account the next day in the afternoon editions. The account in “The Dayton Daily News” gave a reasonably accurate account except that it made a big mistake in indicating that the Wrights were imitators of the world famous Alberto Santos-Dumont. The headline read “DAYTON BOYS EMULATE GREAT SANTOS-DUMONT.”\nSantos-Dumont was a Brazilian who pursued aviation in France. In 1901, he had dazzled the French public by rigging an engine to a hot-air balloon and flew around the Eiffel Tower. The Dayton news-editor didn’t recognize the vast difference between balloons and airplanes.\nThe account in “The Dayton Evening Herald” under the heading of “Dayton Boys Fly Airship,” was a 350-word rehash of the fabricated story that had earlier appeared in the “Norfolk Virginian-Pilot.” The AP, the day after the first flight, had sent out an abbreviated version of the Norfolk piece.\nThe story was full of errors. “The machine flew for three miles — and then gracefully descended to earth at a spot selected by the man in the navigator’s car —.” “Preparatory to flight the machine was placed on a platform on a high sand hill —.” “When the end of the incline was reached the machine gradually arose until it obtained an altitude of sixty feet —.” “There are two six-blade propellers, one arranged just below the frame so as to exert an upward force when in motion and the other extends horizontally to the rear from the center of the car, furnishing the forward impetus.” Orville had run around shouting, “Eureka!”\nThe Wrights, mystified how a short low-keyed message in a telegram could have gone so wrong, prepared a correct story on January 5th of their successful flights and gave it to the AP with a request that it be printed. It appeared in a majority of the AP newspapers the next day.\nExactly one month after the historic flight, the New York Herald still had it wrong and published an article showing a picture with two “six-bladed” propellers and an engine beneath the airplane to provide lift.\nWilbur and Orville gave no details about their airplane. It was their invention, developed at their own expense, and they did not yet intend to provide any pictures or detailed descriptions of their Flyer."

It was the result of years of experiments and design by the Wright brothers, who were operators of a bicycle repair shop and factory in Dayton, Ohio. The brothers continued their flying experiments in Ohio and in Fort Myer, Va., and were granted a patent for the plane in 1906. Wilbur died of typhoid fever in 1912 and Orville sold his interest in the Wright airplane company in 1915. After Orville's death in 1948, the majority of the Wright brothers papers were given by the estate to the Library of Congress. Wright Brothers, Photograph of First Flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, 10:35 AM, December 17, 1903. One of the most famous photographs of all time, this image was made from one of the five-by-seven- inch glass-plate negatives deposited in the Library of Congress in 1949. The camera had been set on a tripod by Orville, who instructed John T. Daniels of the Kill Devil Hill Lifesaving Station how and when to snap the shutter. Daniels did exactly as he was told and the result captures with clarity and drama the world's first airplane flight at the exact moment of liftoff. Orville is at the controls, lying on the lower wing with his hips in a movable cradle which operated the wing-warping mechanism. Wilbur, running alongside to steady the machine, has just released his hold on the upright strut of the wing and probably stepped back to get a better view. This first flight lasted only twelve seconds and went 120 feet; it was followed by three more flights that day, each longer than the previous flight.\n-  Telegram Announcing Success, Orville Wright to Milton Wright, December 17, 1903. Shortly after their history-making flights of December 17, 1903, Orville sent this telegram from Kitty Hawk to his father, Milton, and sister, Katharine, who became the first non-Kitty Hawk residents to learn about their success. Following their eventful and highly successful morning, the Wrights had an unhurried lunch and then walked the few miles to the town of Kitty Hawk to send this historic telegram to their father. The only telegraph equipment in Kitty Hawk was a government wire at the weather bureau office connected to Norfolk, which passed the message on to Western Union. Two errors in transmission were made: Orville's name was misspelled and the time of their longest flight was incorrect (57 seconds instead of the actual 59 seconds). The telegram reached Dayton, Ohio, at 5:25 P.M. and the brothers returned home with their machine on the evening of December 23. Orville Wright's Flight Journal for 1904-05 at Huffman Prairie. Orville's tiny note, taped to the front of this journal, tells why he considered this item special and distinct from all the other Wright journals, notebooks and diaries that he and Wilbur carried in their pockets over the years. His note reads, \"Carried on all flights recorded in it. OW.\" In addition to all the abbreviated, important flight data it contains, this journal is a singular treasure and a unique historical artifact because it went with Orville and Wilbur on each and every one of the Huffman Prairie flights noted in it, from 1904 to 1905. During those years, the Wright's new flyer was sturdier, heavier and had an entirely new engine, and was on its way to becoming a truly practical aircraft.\n-  Presented in Partnership with HISTORY\nRepository\nafrican and middle eastern division\nOnline Format"

    "content": "December 17, 1903\nDecember 17, 1903\n If     this is your first      \nvisit, please stop by:    \n      \n \nAvailable in Franï¿½aise, Espaï¿½ol, Portuguï¿½s, Deutsch, Россию, 中文, 日本, and others.\nistorians     who study the Wright Brothers are often amazed and chagrined that they are best remembered     for the one day when they stepped out of character and made the most risky gamble of their     careers. For four short flights -- after the last of which they wrecked their airplane and nearly     killed a man -- these prudent, sober, intelligent men literally threw their considerable     caution to the wind.\nOn the evening of December 16, there was an ominous black line of     clouds on the horizon. This front advanced quickly and the bane of the east coast, a     noreaster, laid siege to the Wright brothers camp at Kitty Hawk,       North Carolina. The rain abated by morning,     leaving puddles of ice between the sand dunes. The wind, however, continued to blow in     from the ocean, gusting to a fierce 30 miles an hour and creating a chill factor of 4     degrees. Lying fully exposed on the lower wing of their biplane, Wilbur and Orville must     have known the wind would toss them like a feather and cut them like knives.\nThe Wright brothers made a simple breakfast, cleaned up, then studied the     skies for a good long while. You can almost hear the conversation:\n\"What do you think, Will?\"\n\"Its blowing awfully hard, Orv.\"\n\"Maybe it will die down by this afternoon. Or tomorrow morning.\"\n\"Theres no guarantee the weather will get any better. Fact is, the longer we       stay at Kitty Hawk, the worse it will get.\"\n\"And if we dont leave soon, we wont get back to Dayton for       Christmas.\"\nAnd there you have it. The Wright brothers had the first recorded case of     get-home-itis, a potentially fatal malady that afflicts every pilot who ever flew.     Get-home-itis is a broken gear in your head that engages whenever you really want to go     somewhere. It kicks into overdrive when the weather or the aircraft presents a challenge     to your piloting skills. Hundreds of thousands of light-plane pilots have flown to an     early grave because they couldnt disengage and do the smart thing: Stay on the     ground.\nBut the Wrights ignored this sober course for the same reason they ignored the icy,     gusting winds of the noreaster. They wanted to get home for Christmas. A little past     ten in the morning, they took a gamble and nailed a red blanket to the side     of their hangar, a pre-arranged signal to tell the Kitty Hawk Life Saving Crew that they needed help getting the aircraft     ready to fly. While the Wrights waited, they began laying out the wooden track about 200     feet from the hanger.\nNow occurs the first miracle of the day, and the one that is most often     overlooked. Five men -- John Daniels, Adam Etheridge, Will Dough, W.C. Brinkley and Johnny     Moore -- left a cozy station and a warm fire to go to work in the icy, biting wind and     help two eccentric Yankees drag a 600-pound contraption across the frozen sand.  If     you don't think this is a miracle, the next time you're at Kitty Hawk on a cold winter's     day, call the Coast Guard and tell them you need help moving your perpetual motion machine     out to the beach. It's a safe bet they'll make excuses.\nNonetheless, Daniels, Etheridge, Dough, Brinkley, and Moore did not make excuses, and the     world is indebted to them for it. There ought to be a monument to them somewhere in Kitty     Hawk to remind us that there is no such thing as an unimportant act of kindness.\nBy     10:30 AM, the Wrights and their crew had the Flyer positioned on its launching rail.     Wilbur and Orville pulled the propellers, and the engine coughed and sputtered as it     awoke. While the motor was warming up, the brothers stepped aside for a moment by     themselves. \"We couldn't help notice how they held on to each other's hands, sort of     like two folks parting who weren't sure they'd ever see one another again,\" said one     of the life saving crew.\nIt was Orville's turn to fly, and he took his position on the Flyer. He     instinctively did what every good pilot since has done just before take-off -- he checked     his controls, moving the elevator, warping the wings, and turning the rudder. While     Orville was doing this, Wilbur enlisted Daniels to snap a photo just as the Flyer reached     the end of the rail. He also requested for the crew \"not to look too sad, but     to...laugh and holler and clap...to try to cheer Orville up when he started.\" The air     was heavy with history, and Wilbur was trying to lighten the somber mood.\nAbout 10:35, Orville loosed the restraining wire, and the machine began to     move down the rail into a bitter wind that was now gusting to 27 miles per hour.     Wilbur  ran along side. Two thirds of the way down the rail, the Flyer lifted into     the air and the crew cheered. Like Wilbur three days before, Orville underestimated the     effectiveness of the elevator, and the machine rose quickly. Just as quickly, Orville     threw the elevator down and the machine dived. Up again, down again for a breathtaking 12     seconds, and the Flyer landed -- pilot and airplane intact except for one cracked skid --     120 feet from the end of the rail.  For the first time ever, a flying machine had     taken off from level ground, traveled through the air, and landed under the control of its     pilot. It was a wavering, unsteady control to be sure, but it was control just the same.     Orville and Wilbur were elated -- but not satisfied.\nAbout 11:20 AM they made a second flight with Wilbur at the controls, this     time covering 175 feet. Twenty minutes later, Orville flew for a third time and landing     200 feet from the starting point. Finally at 12:00 noon, Wilbur took off for a fourth     time. The beginning of the flight was about like the first three. The Flyer pitched a fit     as the pilot fought to control the elevator.  100 feet out and the aircraft was     bucking up and down like a rodeo bull. At 200 feet, it was worse. But after about 300     feet, Wilbur finally got a feel for the elevator and the Flyer's path began to smooth out.     He had passed the 800 foot mark when a gust of wind caught him and the airplane began its     wild gyrations again. Wilbur fought it for a few seconds, trying to regain control, when     the Flyer \"suddenly darted for the ground,\" as Orville later described it. It     landed 852 feet and 59 seconds from its starting point, snapping the elevator support but     otherwise unharmed. Wilbur and Orville were satisfied. The Flyer flew.\nWhile carrying     the airplane back to the launching point, the men discussed the possibility of repairing     the elevator and making a long flight -- maybe all the way to Kitty Hawk, four miles away.     Just as they put the machine down to take a rest, a sudden gust of wind picked up one     wing. Daniels jumped to grab a strut and was caught in the bracing wires as the machine     rolled over and over again. When it came to rest, it was nothing but kindling wood and     torn cloth. But the day was rife with miracles, and Daniels escaped without a scratch. The     Wright Flyer was not so fortunate. The world's first true airplane would never fly again.\nIt was yet another miracle that it had even flown at all. Much later, aeronautical     engineers would analyze its flight characteristics and discover that the overly sensitive     elevator made it nearly uncontrollable. A computer simulation  by Fred Hooven showed     that a pilot needed the reflexes of a professional athlete to keep the Flyer in the air.     By all accounts, the Wright brothers were superb pilots, but with less than a minute at     the controls of a strange new machine, could they have been that good? Charles Lindbergh,     who flew the Atlantic in 1927, gives another explanation in his Autobiography of     Values.\n\"There are elements in man that escape rational description, that lie beyond the       measurements of science. They may exist at distance beyond the body, yet still exert an       influence within. \"\nThose first few flights were where physics and faith, engineering and poetry all came     together. It was the Wright brothers' time and they rose to the occasion.\nJohnny Moore cried the news to the folks of Kitty Hawk, running to the village     shouting, \"They done it! They done it! Damned if they ain't flew.\"\nThe Wrights themselves were more sedate and in better possession of their     grammar. They ate a quiet lunch, then walked to the Kitty Hawk Weather Bureau to send a     telegram home to Dayton.\n\"SUCCESS FOUR FLIGHTS THURSDAY MORNING ALL AGAINST TWENTY ONE MILE WIND STARTED       FROM LEVEL WITH ENGINE POWER ALONE AVERAGE SPEED THROUGH AIR THIRTY ONE MILES LONGEST 57       SECONDS INFORM PRESS HOME CHRISTMAS. OREVELLE WRIGHT\"\nBishop Milton Wright received the telegram at 7 Hawthorne Street about 5:30 PM, and     showed it o Katharine a few minutes later.  Supper was delayed while the telegram was     sent over to Lorin's home and the news was telegraphed to Octave Chanute. Orville's high     school chum , Paul Laurence Dunbar, had by this time come back to Dayton. The celebrated     poet was resting and trying to beat the tuberculosis that was consuming him. Several     unconfirmed accounts record that Paul stopped by 7 Hawthorne Street not long after the telegram     arrived and the Bishop showed it to him.\nDunbar's visit is probably apocryphal. However, it seems fitting that among the first people to learn of the flights   there would be a minister and a     poet, for that was exactly what mankind needed at that moment. Looking back, we now know     that the airplane was more than an invention, and those first flights more than a get-home     gamble. They were a metaphysical coup-de-tat, a revolution in thought so vast that we are     still sorting out the pieces a century later. Prior to December 17, 1903, the view that     most folks had of their world was two-dimensional, neatly organized and partitioned like an overgrown checkerboard. Our great grandsires traveled from fence to fence and boundary     to boundary, always knowing where they were. After that day in 1903, our lives became     increasingly three-dimensional, the landscape vast and interconnected. The comfortable     divisions by which we made sense of our world vanished like a mirage, as did the old     landmarks by which we steered our course.\nWouldn't you give your eye teeth to know what sermon Bishop Milton Wright preached on     the next Sunday, or what poem Paul Laurence Dunbar penned after he had   learned of his friends' success?     They must have sensed that the world was about to be turned on its ear. What balm did they     offer to deal with the wonder and terror of seeing the world from a height once reserved     for angels? Did they have sage words to replace the ancient wisdom that had been swept     away in the Flyers propeller wash? Or did they simply speculate on the wisdom and     whimsy of a Deity who neglected to give us wings yet obviously intended for man to fly?\n \nClick on a       photo to enlarge it.\nA view of the 1903 Wright camp from Kill Devil Hill.\nWilbur getting the Flyer ready for flight.\nThe Lifesaving Squad at Kitty Hawk.\nOrville checks over the Flyer before takeoff.\nThe photo that John Daniels took at the beginning of the first flight.

The camera had been set on   a tripod by Orville, who instructed John T. Daniels of the Kill Devil Hill Lifesaving Station how and   when to snap the shutter. Daniels did exactly as he was told and the result captures with clarity and   drama the world's first airplane flight at the exact moment of liftoff.

This first flight lasted only twelve seconds   and went 120 feet; it was followed by three more flights that day, each longer than the previous flight.\nEntry from Diary of Orville Wright, December 17, 1903\nIn about six pages of his small pocket diary, Orville set down the details of all four flights that   the brothers made that day. Rather than reveling in their making history and achieving a dream of mankind,   Orville instead provides a matter-of-fact account packed with what he considered the necessary and important   details. Thus his retelling of that day's events contains not a hint of emotion nor hardly anything   subjective, but concentrates on setting the record straight and getting all the facts down. The only   suggestion of drama in Orville's telling is his description of how the wind-tossed machine nearly killed   John T. Daniels, who had become tangled in its engine and chains.\nTelegram, Orville Wright to Milton Wright, December 17, 1903\nFollowing their eventful and highly successful morning, the Wrights had an unhurried lunch and then   walked the few miles to the town of Kitty Hawk to send a telegram to their father. With their machine   wrecked by the wind and flying done for the season, the Wrights immediately thought of going home for   Christmas. The only telegraph equipment in Kitty Hawk was a government wire at the weather bureau office   connected to Norfolk, which passed the message on to Western Union. The telegraph operator at Kitty   Hawk was John T. Dosher, with whom the Wrights had corresponded more than three years before. Two errors   in transmission were made:  Orville's name was misspelled and the time of their longest flight was incorrect   (fifty-seven instead of fifty-nine seconds). The telegram reached Dayton, Ohio, at 5:25 P.M. and the   brothers returned home with their broken machine on the evening of December 23."

The smallest width is 86 km, the smallest fairway depth is 36 m. The strait connects the Arctic Ocean (Chukchi Sea) from the Pacific Ocean (Bering Sea). The strait was named after the Russian explorer Vitus Bering (born in Denmark), sailed on the ship through this strait in 1728.\nTunnel or bridge (Russia - Alaska) across the Bering Strait is - the project to connect Eurasia and North America (Alaska and Chukotka on / under the Bering Strait. The direct connection between North America and Eurasia should contribute to unprecedented economic growth on both continents.\nHistory of the project\n1890\nGovernor of the State of Colorado (USA), William Gilpin, first expressed the idea to connect North America and Eurasia with railway ferry link. The idea was supported by the head of the Union Pacific Railroad of U.S. and includes “Harriman’s plan”.\n1891-1916\nRussia built the Trans-Siberian Railway (Transsib) that is the largest railway track in the world. Its length is 9,000 kilometers.\nThe beginning of XX century\nThe project was approved by Nicholas II, Prime Minister Witte, military and financial ministries. The Government decided to implement the project twice, but it remained unrealized due to force majeure. (First World War interfered, then the October Revolution.)\nSurvey and feasibility study of the project was conducted under the direction of Loïc Delobel (France) and Waddell & Reed (USA).\nThe project was considered to be technically feasible and economically justified.\nKnown researcher of Alaska Loïc Delobel referred to technical Imperial Russian society with the idea to reconnoitre the route from Yakutsk to the Bering Strait and further to Alaska.\nApril 1918\nAt a meeting of the Central Executive Committee Vladimir Lenin put his signature on the decision on the construction of railroads in the eastern and northern parts of the Russian Federation, including in the direction of the Bering Strait, to accelerate the development of natural resources.\n30 – 50s of XX century\nThe project of construction of the North-Siberian railway from Vorkuta to Anadyr is implemented. 1700 kilometers of railways were built.\n60s of XX century\nAmerican engineers have suggested merging the power systems of Russia and the United States. The implementation of a multi - transport corridor ICL - World Link, including power lines, creates prerequisites for the development of the \"energy bridge\" Russia - Alaska. Expert estimates predict savings of $ 20 billion annually.\n90s of XX century\nThe project was discussed at major international conferences in Washington, Moscow, Anchorage, Novosibirsk, Fairbanks, and at a conference at the UN in Barcelona, at Tunneling Conference in Norway, a conference in Finland on the Environmental Issues in the Arctic, a conference on the Arctic Frontiers in Magadan, management of major projects in Norway, at the meeting of management and engineering staff of the railway NAFTA in Montreal.\n1991\nIn Washington (U.S.) International non-profit corporation «Interhemispheric Bering Strait Tunnel and Railroad Group» (IBSTRG) was incorporated, the Russian name is - \"Transcontinental\".\n1996\nThe US government has allocated a budget of $ 10 million for research project ICL - World Link.\nIn Anchorage (United States, Alaska) held a meeting of the working group on cooperation \"Russian Far East - US West Coast\" as the intergovernmental commission Gore - Chernomyrdin. The outcome of the group of Russia and the United States recommended supporting the research program of the project as \"having a lot of potential...”\nThe project is included in the priority programs of the Committee on Cooperation in the Asia Pacific Region (APR).\nAlaska passed a special resolution on the reservation for the future road route.\nInterview with Russian travelers: What body of water separates Alaska from Russia .\nSeptember 2006\nFederal Agency for Railway Transport of the Russian Federation decided to build the railway to Yakutsk - Magadan to the Bering Strait. This highway is a part of the Transcontinental railroad (TCM).\nMarch 2007\nAs a part of the federal target program \"Development of the Far East and Baikal region\" Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov has approved the construction of the road of Berkakit - Tommot - Yakutsk to Magadan, which is an important element of the project ICL - World Link in Russia.\nApril 2007\nRussian President Vladimir Putin reviewed and approved the strategy of development of railway transport in Russia until 2030, the construction of the transcontinental railroad Pravaya Lena - Zyrianka - Whalen length of 3.5 thousand kilometers with access to the Bering Strait. This highway is - a key element of the project ICL - World Link in Russia.\nIn Moscow took place the International Conference \"Transcontinental Railroad Eurasia - America across the Bering Strait.\"\nWhat do you think  how far is Alaska from Russia?\nMay 2007\nRussian Transport Minister Igor Levitin said that the budget for the construction of a tunnel under the Bering Strait will not be spent. According to him, \"the tunnel could be financed by private companies, if they deem it profitable.\"\nTechnical criticism of the project\nAn example of modern technical possibilities - there is an Oresund - bridge – the Tunnel and bridge between Denmark and Sweden.\nCritics of the project say that the project exceeds the current technical capabilities. At the same time, its supporters say that the distance between the shores of the strait at the narrowest point is quite large (86 km), but the distance to the Big Diomede Island (Ratmanov Island) substantially less than the length of the longest in the world (53.9 km) tunnel connecting the Japanese islands Honshu and Hokkaido.\nPublicly announced a project of the construction of a 180-kilometer underwater tunnel connecting Japan and South Korea, gives the reason to believe that the construction of the 90-100 km tunnel under the Bering Strait is the most feasible, given the fact that according to the degree of seismic hazard and the necessary depth of the tunnel, the project between Eurasia and America looks much simpler.  Can you drive from Alaska to Russia? Rean more...\nIt is argued that the costs for the completion of the Eurasian route of railroad from Chukotka to the Trans-Siberian Railway is disproportionately large, and never repaid (completion of the missing sections of the railroad in the United States and Canada also looks quite expensive).\nThese claims are largely valid, but critics generally offer for consideration is not quite correct routes going through the mountains of Yakutia or along the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk through Magadan."

    "content": "Neighbors Russia and Alaska\nIn her Sept. 11 interview with ABC's Charlie Gibson, Sarah Palin had this to say about Russia: \"They're our next-door neighbors, and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska.\" Is that true?\nYes. Russia and Alaska are divided by the Bering Strait, which is about 55 miles at its narrowest point. In the middle of the Bering Strait are two small, sparsely populated islands : Big Diomede, which sits in Russian territory, and Little Diomede, which is part of the United States. At their closest, these two islands are a little less than two and a half miles apart, which means that, on a clear day, you can definitely see one from the other. The Diomede Islands are often blanketed by persistent fog, which makes visibility difficult. On a clear day, though, a person standing at sea level can see a little less than three miles across the ocean. You can see farther if you go higher —at the highest altitude on Little Diomede (919 feet), you can see for about 37 miles. (Between mid-December and mid-June, when the water between the two islands freezes , an intrepid explorer can just walk from one to the other.)\nAdvertisement\nThe tactical importance of this proximity is debatable, however:Big Diomede has no permanent population though it does house an important weather station. Alaskans can, however, see into the future from Little Diomede since Big Diomede (or Ratmanov Island, as it's known to the Russians) is on the other side of the International Date Line .\nYou can also see Russia from other points in Alaska. According to a New York Times article written in the waning years of the Cold War (when the Alaska-Siberia border was known as the \"Ice Curtain\"), if you stand on high ground on the tip of St. Lawrence Island—a larger Alaskan island in the Bering Sea, southwest of the Diomedes—you can see the Russian mainland, about 37 miles away. The same article claims that you can see Russia from the Tin City Air Force facility at Cape Prince of Wales, which is the westernmost point of the mainland Americas.The station chief at Tin City confirms that, for roughly half the year, you can see Siberian mountain ranges from the highest part of the facility.\nIt's not as if Alaskans can see into the heart of the Kremlin, though. The region you'd be seeing from these vantage points is the Chukotka autonomous district , a massive, desolate expanse of about 285,000 square miles with a population of about 55,000. (That's an area roughly the size of Texaswith a population the size of Pine Bluff, Ark .) Chukotka has fewer than 400 miles of road and no railroad infrastructure; the population is mostly employed in mining and subsistence hunting. The more strategic areas of the Russian coastline, militarily speaking—the Kamchatka Peninsula, home to a nuclear submarine base, or Vladivostok, headquarters of the Russian Pacific Fleet—are not visible from Gov. Palin's home state.\nPalin does have Obama beat, though: The closest foreign territory to Hawaii is the Micronesian Republic of Kiribati , but at more than 1,000 miles away, it's not remotely visible with the naked eye."

The distance across the strait from the United States to Russia is 58 miles.\nFull Answer\nThe boundary between the United States and Russia is located in the middle of the Bering Strait, at the site of the Big and Little Diomedes islands. Archaeologists believe that during the last Ice Age, the two continents were connected by a land bridge that eroded over time due to strong seas and winds. While there has been discussion of connecting the two continents again via bridges or tunnels, the expense and weather conditions make such a connection difficult."

    "content": "Great Land of Alaska - Alaskan FAQ\nGreat Land of Alaska\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDo you have a question about Alaska? Ask me and I'll    answer by e-mail or add it to this page if it's something I get asked a lot.\nHow many miles is it from Alaska to Russia?\nDo you live in an igloo?\nNo, I live in an perfectly normal 7-plex. All cities and major towns in Alaska have regular houses, apartments,    buildings, etc. Even in the bush, people live in houses.\nDon't you get cold?\nIf I went outside in the middle of January wearing nothing but a t-shirt and shorts, then I'd get cold. However, like    anybody else who lives somewhere that gets below freezing during the winter, I dress to keep warm.\nHow do you keep warm?\nThat depends on where I am and what I'm doing. In just normal travelling from home to work or to the store, I'm never    outside long enough to get too cold. If I'm ice fishing, I can plan on being outside in -20° C weather for several hours, so I dress    for it - long johns, jeans, sweater, button-up shirt, snowpants, down coat, face mask, scarf, thick hat, thick gloves, and bunny    boots.\nWhat are bunny boots?\nBunny Boots [picture] are extreme cold-weather boots. They are made of an inner and an outer    layer of rubber so they are waterproof. Between the two layers of rubber is insulating felt, as well as as insulating layer of air. A    valve in the side of the boot allows the wearer to adjust the air inside according to the outside air pressure. I've worn my bunny boots    while ice fishing and while servicing a TV transmitter on the side of a mountain in the middle of winter, and my feet have never been    cold.\nIs it really dark most of the year?\nThis surprises a lot of people, but Alaska doesn't have more darkness than light. It may be dark most of the time    during the winters, but during the summer it is light most of the time so it evens out. How long the darkness/light lasts depend on how    far north you are. In Barrow, the sun may not rise during the middle of winter, and may not set during the summer. In the Southcentral,    the sun does set during the summer but it may not get any darker than twilight. The sun does rise in winter but doesn't get very high as    you can see in this picture taken near noon on the Winter Solstice.\nDo you have electricity and computers up there?\nHow else would I have created this web page?\nIs all of Alaska covered by ice?\nOnly about 5% of Alaska is covered by permanent ice. The rest of it is swamp, forest, mountain, plains, tundra, muskeg,    marsh, etc.\nDo you get a lot of snow?\nThat depends on where in Alaska you are. Some parts of Alaska are desert and so receive little precipitation in any    form. Other areas can receive several meters of snow during the winter. In the part of Alaska I live in, we average a few feet per    year.\nDo you travel by dog sled?\nI drive a Dodge pickup. In the city, cars are the primary means of transportation. In the bush areas, cars and trucks    may be used, but 3-wheelers, 4-wheelers, and snowmachines are the main forms of transportation. Most dog teams that exist today are    mainly used for sport, although a few bush villages still use dog teams for transportation.\nDo you use Russian/Canadian currency?\nWe use American money. I have noticed, however, that many Alaskan stores and vending machines will accept Canadian    coins.    All the lower-48 stores I've been to refuse to accept any Canadian coins, period.\nDo you have penguins up there?\nAside from the 'beanie baby' type of toy penguins, we do not have any, not even at the zoo. Most people associate    penguins with snow, ice, and cold weather. Although we have the climate that people would expect penguins to live in, they are only found    in the southern hemisphere.\nHave you seen any bears?\nI've not seen as many as a lot of people have, but I have seen a few. In my entire life in Alaska, I've only seen 6    wild Black Bears (2 of them were cubs) and about a dozen wild Grizzly Bears.\nWhat kinds of wildlife have you seen?\nI've seen moose, caribou, lynx, fox, coyotes, beluga whales, sea otters, harbour seals, sea lions, mink, porcupines,    beavers, muskrats, rabbits, owls, eagles, hawks, and too many small critters to mention.\nAre Moose dangerous?\nMoose, if provoked, can be quite a deadly animal. A single kick from one can be fatal. There are a lot of moose in town    and most of them will leave people alone if given enough room. There have been a few fatal attacks though, but these have happened    because the victim came too close (not always intentionally--moose can be hard to see in the dark of night). I've heard (from    professional hunting guides so I tend to believe this) that in the wild one often has more to fear from moose than bears in that a moose    may attack without any provocation.\nHow much does the average king crab weigh?\nAn average Alaskan King Crab typically weighs around 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and its leg span is about 2 feet (0.6 meters).    They can grow up to 24 pounds (10.9 kg) with a leg span of 5 feet (1.5 meters). The size typically caught by crab fishermen and sold in    stores and restaurants is around 10 pounds.\nCan you speak Eskimo?\nFirst, I'd like to say there there isn't any single language that can be called 'Eskimo'. There are different groups of    Eskimos in Alaska and they each have a different language such as Inupiaq, Yup'ik, and Siberian Yup'ik. The Native people of the area I    grew up in were Yup'ik Eskimo so Yup'ik was the language spoken in that area. I know many Yup'ik words and phrases, but I don't know    enough to carry on a conversation. It wasn't really necessary for me to learn Yup'ik since most people there spoke English as well.\nHave you ever been in an earthquake?\nYes, lots of them. Alaska has over 1,000 earthquakes each year that measure 3.5 or higher on the Richter scale. Only a    small handfull of these earthquakes are near enough to where I live for me to feel them.\nWhat's the largest earthquake you've ever been in?\nThat would be the November 3rd earthquake of 2002, a 7.9 quake that hit the Alaska Range. I live quite far away from    the epicenter so it didn't feel that severe to me, although the ground did shake for a long time.\nWhat is there to do if I visit Alaska?\nThat depends on what you like doing. If you're into outdoor sports there's hiking, fishing, camping, kayaking,    canoeing, and biking. If you're into history and culture, there's plenty of places to visit to learn about both, such as Anchorage, Nome,    Juneau, Skagway, and many others. If you're visiting for the scenery and wildlife, there's the cruise through the Inside Passage, Kenai    Fjords tours, many glacier cruises, Denali Park tours, the Alaska Railroad, dozens of flightseeing companies, and much more.\nWhat causes the northern lights?\nThe origin of the Aurora borealis is the sun. Every now and then a solar flare on the sun's surface will send    a bunch of charged particles hurtling through space. If the Earth is in the path of this cloud, some of the particles will become trapped    in the Earth's magnetic field and will follow the lines of magnetic force to the magnetic north and south poles where they enter the    atmosphere. As the particles encounter the various gasses of the atmosphere, they begin to glow in colors such as green (the most common    color), red, blue, and violet.\nIs it true that moose were attacking airplanes in    Anchorage several years ago?\nIf that's what you heard, then somebody along the way has exaggerated the story a bit. Bull moose lose their antlers in    the fall and often try to speed the process up by rubbing them again large objects such as trees or boulders. If a moose happens to be    wandering through an airport when it decides to start scraping, it'll use any large object it can find, such as a small private    single-engine airplane. Several small private airplanes near Anchorage's international airport were damaged this way, but no airplanes    have actually been 'attacked'.\nDo you eat whale blubber?\nMaqtaq (whale blubber) isn't a part of my regular diet, but I do like it and will eat it if I get a chance. There's    really nothting I can compare the flavor to, it has its own taste. It can be eaten raw (a little chewy) or it can be boiled (easier to    chew). It goes well with seal oil and a little salt.\nCan you see Russia from Alaska?\nLittle Diomede Island (Alaska) and Big Diomede Island (Russia) are only about 2.5 miles (4 km) apart so Russia can    definitely be seen from Alaska as long as it's light out and the weather hasn't reduced visibility below a couple miles. As for mainland    Russia being visible from mainland Alaska, I can't answer this question with any certainty since I've never been to Alaska's Seward    Peninsula or Russia's Chukotsk Peninsula. However, with my knowledge of geography I can probably make an educated guess, and my guess is    that the mainlands are too far apart (52 miles/83 km) to see each other. If the mountains on either peninsula were higher then it's more    likely that you'd be able to see mainland Russia from mainland Alaska. After all, Denali is visible from Kenai and it's 180 miles/290 km    away. However, Denali is 20,320 feet (6,194 meters) tall and the mountains on the Seward Peninsula and Chukotsk Peninsula are much, much    smaller. I'd guess the best chance to see mainland Russia from mainland Alaska is to climb to the top of the York Mountains (just east of    Wales on the western tip of the Seward Peninsula) on a very clear day and hope for a Fata Morgana . Without the aid of some kind of mirage, I'd say that it's    impossible to see mainland Russia from mainland Alaska.\nWhat body of water separates Alaska and Russia?\nAlaska and Russia are such large areas that you could say that many bodies of water separate them. Between the Aleutian    Islands and Russia lies the Bering Sea. Between Alaska's Seward Pensinsula and Russia's Chukotsk Peninsula is the Bering Strait. And the    Chukchi Sea separates the northwestern part of Alaska and the northeastern part of Russia.\nWhat bodies of water border Alaska?\nAlaska has many bodies of water bordering it. To the north is the Arctic Ocean and Beaufort Sea. To the northwest is    the Chukchi Sea. The Bering Strait and Bering Sea lie along the west and southwest of Alaska, as well as the north of the Aleutian    Islands. The Pacific Ocean borders the southern coastline of Alaska.\nHow many mountain ranges are in Alaska?\nThis depends on what definition of \"mountain range\" you follow. Typically, many people and publications    consider there to be 11 mountain ranges in Alaska: Alaska Range, Aleutian Range, Brooks Range, Chugach Mountains, Coast Mountains, Kenai    Mountains, Kuskokwim Mountains, Nulato Hills, St. Elias Mountains, Talkeetna Mountains, and Wrangell Mountains. If you want to get    technical, many of these groups are actually considered to be the same range, such as the Chugach Mountains and the Kenai Mountains or    the Alaska Range and the Talkeetna Mountains. Then there are the mountains that aren't counted as mountain ranges, such as the mountains    on the Seward Peninsula or the Yukon/Tanana Uplands. Of course, there are also dozens of smaller ranges within each of the ranges I've    named. For example, Ahklun Mountains and Kilbuck Mountains, both subranges of the Kuskokwim Mountains.\nSee my Mountain Ranges page for more information on Alaskan mountain ranges.\nWhat are the two major mountain ranges in Alaska?\nThe Alaska Range and Brooks Range are considered to be Alaska's two largest mountain ranges.\nSee my Mountain Ranges page for more information on Alaskan mountain ranges.\nWhy does snow stay on mountain tops?\nThree factors, acting alone or in combination, allow snow to remain on mountain tops well into summer and even all year    long: temperature, snow quantity, and sunlight (or lack thereof). Many higher mountains are so high that the temperature at their tops    rarely climbs far above freezing, even in the middle of summer. Massive amounts of snow can create snow drifts so deep that it may take    until July or even August for it to melt. This, combined with the lower temperatures at high altitudes, enables snow to remain on    mountain tops long after it's melted from the lower areas. Finally, since the sun in Alaska remains relatively near the horizon in the    summer, the northern sides of many mountain tops receive little direct sunlight, slowing the melting of the snow.\nWhy don't lakes and rivers freeze solid?\nIf they're small enough, they will. However, any lake or river of sufficient size will not freeze solid. The reason    most lakes and rivers don't freeze solid is because water, ice, and snow are good insulators and poor conductors of heat. The portions of    a lake or river that are exposed to the cold winter air will freeze into ice and this ice insulates the water below from further rapid    freezing. Also contributing to the prevention of bodies of water freezing solid is an interesting characteristic of water. Like most    other forms of matter, water become denser as it cools, but beginning at about 39°F (4°C) something odd happens - water begins to    lose density as it gets colder, becoming least dense when it freezes into ice. This is why ice floats. As water becomes colder it rises    to the top, eventually freezing to the layers of ice that are already there. Insulation of the water beneath is increased as the ice    thickens so cooling of the water beneath slows. Many lakes will eventually freeze solid if given enough time. Fortunately, spring thaw    arrives long before that happens. As for rivers, a river with a swift enough current will not freeze solid due to the constant motion of    the water.\nWhy do lakes and rivers freeze but oceans don't?\nActually, oceans do freeze, although the high salt levels lowers the freezing point to around 28.4°F (-2°C).    The polar ice cap that many of us have been hearing about so much lately is, in fact, frozen ocean. The ocean around Alaska freezes in    the winter, with sea ice occasionally extending as far south as 60° to 62° N lattitude. The winter is not cold enough for long    enough for more of the ocean to freeze, and with the arrival of spring and summer the warmer temperatures causes this ice shelf to melt.    However, the parts of the ocean north of Alaska, Canada, and Russia remains frozen all year long although this ice cap is showing signs    of shrinkage due to climate change.\nHow long is the Iditarod sled dog race?\nThe Idtiarod sled dog race begins in Wasilla and ends in Nome. It covers approximately 1,100 miles (1,770    kilometres).\nWhy does the sun not rise in Barrow during the     winter? / Why does the sun not set in Barrow during the summer?\nThe Earth does not sit level in space. If you were to imagine a large, flat surface that the Earth and Sun sit on, you    would notice that the Earth's North Pole does not point straight up, it actually points about 23.45° away from straight up. This    tilting of the earth is why Barrow receives so much sun during summer and so much darkness in winter. The picture below illustrates    Earth's position in relation to the sun during the four seasons. In this illustration, the red dot represents the North Pole (off to the    side because the Earth does not point straight up), the yellow ring represents the path that Barrow takes as the Earth rotates, and the    small green dot represents Barrow's position at mid-day at each of the four locations.\nBarrow is located relatively near the North Pole (approximately 71° 30\" N), making it only about 18° 30\" south of    the North Pole. Since this is less than the Earth's 23.45° tilt, that means that Barrow has a lot of sunshine when the North Pole is    pointed towards the sun in summer. The summer position in the illustration above shows how the Earth's tilt is such that Barrow's entire    path is in sunlight during the longest days of summer. The illustration shows how the North Pole is tilted away from the sun during the    winter and Barrow's entire path is in shadow.\nHow many miles is it from Alaska to Russia?\nThe Bering Strait is where Alaska and Russia are at their closest. The Russian and Alaskan mainlands are approximately    52 miles/83 km from each other. That's from the western tip of Alaska's Seward Peninsula and Russia's Chukotsk Peninsula. In the middle    of the strait are two Islands, Little Diomede (Alaska) and Big Diomede (Russia). These two islands are about 2.5 miles/4 km apart.\nCopyright © Douglas Gates"

    "content": "WHO WAS FIRST -- Ancient Immigrants Into The Americas - Bering Strait and the Land Bridge\nThe Bering Strait and The Land Bridge\nThe Bering Strait links the Arctic Ocean with the Bering Sea and separates the continents of Asia and North America at their closest point. The strait averages 98 to 164 ft (30 to 50 m) in depth and at its narrowest is about 53 mi (85 km) wide. There are numerous islands in the strait, including the two Diomede Islands (about 6 sq mi [16 sq km]), and to the south of the strait lies St. Lawrence Island (about 1,000 sq mi). The U.S.-Russian boundary extends through the strait.\nSome of the Bering Sea water passes through the strait into the Arctic Ocean, but most of it returns to the Pacific. In winter the region is subject to severe storms and the sea is covered by ice fields averaging 4 to 5 ft thick. In mid-summer drift ice remains in the Bering Strait. The strait is named after Vitus Bering, a Danish captain, who sailed into the strait in 1728.\nSome 20,000 to 25,000 years ago, towards the end of the Pleistocene (Ice Ages), monumental continental glaciers forming in the earth's northern hemisphere (especially in Canada and Greenland) locked up so much water that the world's ocean levels were more than 300 feet lower than today. In the region of the Bering Strait, this drop in sea levels exposed a massive unglaciated tract known the Bering Land Bridge. This bridge joined northeast Asia to modern Alaska and formed part of a much larger province called Beringa. When fully exposed Beringia was over 1000 miles wide. Many scientists presume that it supported a tundra vegetation where Arctic fauna, particularly the caribou, flourished.\nFor most of the 20th century, archaeologists and anthropologists assumed that the forbears of the Native Americans moved across this land bridge following the game animals. However, towards the end of the 20th century, additional routes by which human beings first reached the Americas were being proposed: following the southern coastline of Beringia and Alaska, then southward along the Pacific coast all the way to the southernmost tip of South America, exploiting the rich marine fauna (shellfish, fish, sea mammals, seaweed) along the way. This coastal route could have been by foot along the beach, or by boat, drifting eastward then southward with the Japanese current. It's also possible that the first humans into the Americas exploited both coastal and interior resources.\nBelow is an article by Don Alan Hall which appeared in the MAMMOTH TRUMPET VOL 12, NO. 2 (1997) which discusses new findings concerning when the Bering Land Bridge was open, what the environmental conditions on the Bridge were like, and what that meant in terms of suitability for human subsistence and use.\nBering Land Bridge Was Open Until After 11,000 Years Ago - Scrub Tundra Grew in Lowland Beringia, Not 'Mammoth Steppe'\nJust a few decades ago, Beringia, the land linking North America and Asia during glacial times, was a hypothetical concept. But as evidence mounted of biological connections between Siberia and Alaska, and knowledge of changing sea levels came to light, the notion of a land bridge allowing free passage of animals and humans became universally accepted. Until recently, the connection was thought to have been severed by rising sea levels about 14,000 years ago.\nNow, thanks to research by Scott A. Elias and his colleagues, we know the link remained in place until sometime after 11,000 years ago, probably being flooded about 10,500 years B.P. The event cut the Americas off from Eurasia for the first time in many thousands of years. When the level of the Pacific Ocean rose to within about 40 meters of its present level, it spilled across into the Arctic Ocean.\nDr. Elias, of the University of Colorado's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, is able to tell us much about the lowland that once constituted the land bridge because of careful research employing cores previously collected by the U.S. Geological Survey from the floor of the Chukchi and Bering seas. Not only did the work reveal that the land bridge was open to passage long after scientists thought it had been closed, the research provided new insights into the environment before the continents were separated. Elias found that land bridge lowland had been covered with shrub tundra that would not have provided much food for grazing animals; he found no evidence of the steppe tundra that some believe must have been plentiful to nourish the great Pleistocene bison and mammoth herds with its grasses.\nHowever, it is clear that people and animals could have freely crossed the land bridge until after 11,000 years B.P. Elias can describe the paleoenvironment of the land bridge because of research he and his colleagues have done on pollen and the remains of insects and plants. These environmental markers became preserved in shallow pools in the Beringian lowland, and when melting glaciers raised sea levels, the fossils were protected from the flood.\nThe research had its origins more than a decade ago when the U.S. Geological Survey sailed the U.S. research ship Discovery in the Bering and Chukchi seas to gather geologic and geophysical information. The project included the taking of dozens cores from the sea floor. These cores, about 10 cm in diameter, ranged up to nine meters in length. After the voyage, the USGS stored the cores, sealed in plastic tubes, under refrigeration at Palo Alto and Redwood City, Calif.\nElias began his research by looking through the core logs from USGS cruises in the Bering and Chukchi seas. The goal, of course, was to find cores that would yield information about the most-recent terrestrial deposits-- layers that could be expected to contain plant and insect remains.\n\"We picked cores that had organic lenses near their tops,\" Elias said. \"We knew that these organic layers would represent the land bridge.\" The topmost core material represented Holocene marine sand, deposited after the Pacific Ocean had flooded northward. Below that were sediments from the land bridge. Below the land-bridge sediments the cores revealed an as-yet-unexplained gap in the geologic record--the next sediments are Cretaceous in age.\nElias and his colleagues then went to the USGS storage rooms to look up their chosen cores. It wasn't quite like looking up a reference in the library, because about half of the cores were stored in a refrigerated trailer near the bay at Redwood City. During the Loma Prieta earthquake a few years previously, all the cores in the trailer had fallen from their shelves and they remained in a jumble on the floor. \"We had to unload literally the entire contents of the trailer--hundreds of cores--out into the parking lot in order to find the ones we were interested in.\"\nThey dug the organic lenses out of the cores and took them back to Boulder to extract the fossils. \"The organic deposits were easy to differentiate because they are nearly black, whereas the rest of the sediments are nearly sterile marine sands and clays, tan to gray in color.\"\nAccurately dating the deposits was a high priority of the research team. Previous land-bridge closure dates had been obtained from radiocarbon analysis of bulk samples, and there was a suspicion of contamination by coal. Elias and his colleagues wet-screened the samples to remove any such material, and chose individual macrofossils for radiocarbon dating by accelerator mass spectrometry. Elias found that samples of cores taken in the Chukchi Sea could provide the most accurate dating of the submergence of the land bridge.\nAMS dates from screened peat from cores taken north of Alaska's Cape Lisburne were 11,330 +/- 70 years B.P. (Beta 43952) and 11,000 +/- 60 (Beta 43953). Analysis of the cores, then, indicated that the sea covered the land bridge after 11,000 B.P.; probably by 10,500 B.P.\nElias' insect analysis is done the same way archaeologists do faunal analysis of larger animals. \"I compare my fossils with modern specimens in museum collections.\" There are two principal differences between analyzing remains of beetles and remains of mammals--evolution and scale.\n\"As far as we can tell, there has been no evolution of species and no extinction of species during most, if not all, of the Quaternary,\" he says. \"So 999 out of 1,000 insect fossil specimens have living counterparts in their own species with which to compare ecological requirements and modern distribution patterns.\"\nElias finds insects' small size an advantage. \"Insects are far easier to work with than mammals. I have more than 10,000 fossil specimens and 5,000 modern specimens in cabinets in my office, whereas a fossil- and modern-mammal collection of this number of specimens might take a gymnasium to house. I use a low-power stereo-binocular microscope to identify my specimens, but for picture taking, I prefer to use the scanning electron microscope because the images of three-dimensional specimens are sharper.\"\nThe research went back in time far beyond the final submergence of the land bridge. Elias says that fossil samples fell into three age classes--more than 40,000 years old, 20,000-14,000 years old, and 14,000-11,000 years old. Generally, the oldest period represented an environment of birch-heath-grass tundra with a few shrubs, while the middle period was tundra with fewer heaths. The latest period again was dominated by birch-heath-grass tundra--moderately moist--and there were small ponds choked with aquatic plants. By 12,000 years B.P. summer temperatures were as warm as they are now and by 11,000 B.P. summers were warmer than Alaska's north slope now experiences.\nElias and paleobotanist Susan K. Short (INSTARR) and Hilary H. Birks (University of Bergen Norway) found no evidence for steppe-tundra vegetation at any period. R. Dale Guthrie of the University of Alaska's Institute of Arctic Biology has hypothesized that Beringia was a vast steppe covered with grasses and sagebrush. Dr. Guthrie, an authority on large Pleistocene mammals, argues that Alaska's plentiful fossil record means that Beringia must have offered highly productive grazing to have allowed bison, mammoths, and other grazers to reach such giant size. Elias and his colleagues, however, have not found evidence of extensive expanses of that steppe habitat, nor had earlier work by palynologists. Is Guthrie wrong?\n\"I think that we could easily both be right,\" said Elias. \"The land bridge may have been a narrow waist of mesic tundra surrounded by steppe-tundra landscapes on either side.\" He notes that the land bridge probably could not have sustained many big grass eaters. \"I don't think that there was much for megafaunal mammals to graze on out there on the land bridge, but they may have migrated across the narrowest part of the Bering Strait region in just a few days.\"\n\"Based on our evidence, grazing animals and their human hunters probably spent little time on the land bridge. Shrub tundra offers too few food resources for the animals.\"\nAs far as the timing of human migration across the continental link, Elias doesn't believe evidence that the land bridge was usable until after 11,000 years B.P. has anything to say about when the first people reached North America. \"Certainly the new dates mean that the land bridge was available to people until Clovis time, but the land bridge had been open for many thousands of years before then, as well. Furthermore, you can still walk from Siberia to Alaska across the Bering Strait in winter.\" Because the water is so shallow, he says, it often freezes completely; Inuit people do travel between Alaska and Siberia to visit friends and relatives.\nElias would like to broaden his research by examining deposits from other areas. \"First I'd like to get cores from the southern part of the Bering shelf--the south sector of the land bridge.\" Deposits from cores taken in waters south of the Bering Strait yielded older dates, possibly because the stormier sea caused erosion of the most recent terrestrial deposits. \"Second, I'd like to get my hands on cores from the Russian side of the Bering and Chukchi seas.\"\nHe says Russian scientists took cores there about the same time the USGS was coring on the Alaskan side. \"I have recently sent out an e-mail to Russian colleagues in Moscow, trying to find out where these cores are being kept and whether I could get permission to go sample from them. I hope that the cores haven't been lost or thrown out, but with the near-collapse of the Russian science infrastructure, I am worried about the fate of these cores.\"\n-- Don Alan Hall"

    "content": "Chinese Cultural Studies: Concise Political History of China\nConcise Political History of China\nCompiled from Compton's Living Encyclopedia on America Online (August 1995)\n1. HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL CONTINUITY\nA significant aspect of China is its long cultural and national history. The Chinese   people have shared a common culture longer than any other group on Earth. The Chinese   writing system, for example, dates back almost 4,000 years. The imperial dynastic system   of government, which continued for centuries, was established as early as 221 BC. Although   specific dynasties were overturned, the dynastic system survived. China was even ruled at   times by foreign invaders, such as the Mongols during the Yuan Dynasty, from AD 1279 to   1368, and the Manchus during the Ch'ing Dynasty, from AD 1644 to 1911, but the foreigners   were largely absorbed into the culture they governed. It is as if the Roman Empire had   lasted from the time of the Caesars to the 20th century, and during that time had evolved   a cultural system and written language shared by all the peoples of Europe.\nThe dynastic system was overturned in 1911, and a weak republican form of government   existed until 1949. In that year, after a long civil war, the People's Republic of China,   with a Communist government, was proclaimed. This government and the ruling Communist   party have controlled China ever since. Although the dynastic system has disappeared, the   People's Republic occupies essentially the same territory and governs the same people. If   anything, the culture and power of China seem stronger in the late 20th century than at   almost any other period in history. Under the People's Republic, China's role in world   economic and political affairs has grown increasingly more important.\n2. BEGINNINGS AND EARLY HISTORY\nArchaeological evidence suggests that China is one of the cradles of the human race.   The earliest known human in China, whose fossilized skull was unearthed in Shanxi Province   in 1963, is believed to date back to 600,000 BC. The remains of Sinanthropus pekinensis,   known as Peking Man and dating back to 400,000 BC, were excavated in 1923 at   Zhoukoudianzhen near Peking. Peking Man was closely related to Pithecanthropus of Java and   lived during the Old Stone Age. In the upper caves of Zhoukoudianzhen are found artifacts   of a late Old Stone Age man (50,000-35,000 BC), who ranks in age with the Cro-Magnon of   Europe. This was an early form of Homo sapiens, or modern man, who made tools out of bones   as well as stones, made clothes out of animal hides, and knew how to make fire.\nAround the 4th or 3rd millennium BC, in the New Stone Age, great changes occurred in   the lives of the ancient Chinese. Larger numbers of people began living together at   settled places, cultivating land, and domesticating animals. These people made polished   stone tools and built shelters in pit dwellings and beehive huts that were covered with   reed roofs. Such villages were found mostly in the area of the great bend of the Huang He   on the North China Plain. Despite its severe winters, this area was well suited to   agriculture. In fact, it closely resembled the other cradles of ancient civilizations,   such as the valley of the Nile in Egypt.\nThe people of this period (3000-2000 BC) also developed the art of making pottery for   storing food and drink. Two distinct types have been discovered: red clay pots with   swirling black designs in the northwest near Yangshao village, and smooth black pottery in   northeast China near Lungshan, a site in Shandong Province.\n3. SHANG DYNASTY\nThe Chinese had settled in the Huang He, or Yellow River, valley of northern China by   3000 BC. By then they had pottery, wheels, farms, and silk, but they had not yet   discovered writing or the uses of metals.\nThe Shang Dynasty (1766-1122 BC) is the first documented era of ancient China. The   highly developed hierarchy consisted of a king, nobles, commoners, and slaves. The capital   city was Anyang, in north Henan Province. Some scholars have suggested that travelers from   Mesopotamia and from Southeast Asia brought agricultural methods to China, which   stimulated the growth of ancient Chinese civilization. The Shang peoples were known for   their use of jade, bronze, horse-drawn chariots, ancestor worship, and highly organized   armies.\nLike other ancient peoples, the Chinese developed unique attributes. Their form of   writing, developed by 2000 BC, was a complex system of picture writing using forms called   ideograms, pictograms, and phonograms. Such early forms of Chinese became known through   the discovery by archaeologists of oracle bones, which were bones with writings inscribed   on them. They were used for fortune-telling and record keeping in ancient China.\nBone libraries and others: ancient times. The earliest known libraries were   connected with palaces and temples. In China, records of the Shang dynasty (1767?-1123?   BC) were written on animal bones and tortoise shells. An early library called \"The   Healing Place of the Soul,\" in the palace of Egypt's King Ramses II (1304?-1237 BC)   at Thebes, consisted of thousands of papyrus scrolls. Among the most important libraries   in the ancient Near East was the palace library of Ashurbanipal (668?-627? BC) at Nineveh   in Assyria. This early type of national library, collected \"for the sake of distant   days,\" consisted of over 30,000 clay tablets. Early librarians were usually priests,   teachers, or scholars. The first known Chinese librarian was the philosopher Lao Tse, who   was appointed keeper of the royal historical records for the Chou rulers about 550 BC.\n4. CHOU DYNASTY (1122-221 BC)\nThe Chou Dynasty (1122-221 BC) saw the full flowering of ancient civilization in China.   During this period the empire was unified, a middle class arose, and iron was introduced.   The sage Confucius (551-479 BC) developed the code of ethics that dominated Chinese   thought and culture for the next 25 centuries (See Confucius).\nThe Chou conquest of the Shang was given an important meaning by later moralistic   interpretations of the event. The Chou kings, whose chief deity was heaven, called   themselves \"Sons of Heaven,\" and their success in overcoming the Shang was seen   as the \"mandate of heaven.\" From this time on, Chinese rulers were called \"Sons of Heaven\" and the Chinese Empire, the \"Celestial Empire.\" The   transfer of power from one dynasty to the next was based on the mandate of heaven.\nChou rule in China continued for nearly nine centuries. During that time great advances   were made. The long period of the Chou Dynasty is divided into two subperiods: Western   (Early) and Eastern (Later) Chou, named for the locations of the capitals.\nWestern (Early) Chou (1122-771 BC).\nWestern Chou territory covered most of the North China Plain. It was divided into about   200 princely domains. The Chou political system was similar to the feudal system of   medieval Europe. The Chou people combined hunting and agriculture for a living.   Associating the success or failure of crops with the disposition of nature, the people   prayed to numerous nature gods for good harvests. One of the ruler's duties was to placate   heaven and Earth for all people. Failure to do so deprived him of the right to rule. Such   beliefs are still widely held today among the Chinese people. Ancestor worship also   developed during the Chou period and has been important in East Asia for the last 2,000   years.\nThe Chou were invaded in 771 BC by a less cultured, more militaristic people from the   northwest. The capital was moved east to Luoyang. From this point on, the dates are   considered reliable. The manner in which the Western Chou fell followed a pattern that was   repeated throughout Chinese history. People who led a nomadic, or wandering, life in the   northern steppe land would invade settled agricultural communities to solve periodic food   shortages.\nThe conflict between the nomads and settled farmers has been a continuing feature of   Chinese history. Settled Chinese called the nomads \"barbarians,\" a term applied   to all peoples of non-Chinese culture up to the 20th century. From this concept an idea   developed that China was the center of the\ncivilized world, hence the traditional name \"Middle Kingdom/Country,\" referring to China.\nEastern (Later) Chou (771-221 BC).\nThe Eastern Chou is also two periods. The first is Ch'un Ch'iu, the Spring and Autumn   period (771-481 BC), named for a book credited to Confucius. The second is Chan-kuo, the   Warring States period\n(481-221 BC).\nIn the Spring and Autumn period, iron replaced bronze for tools and weapons. The use of   iron led to an increase in agricultural output, growth of the population, and warfare   among the states. By the 4th century BC the number of states had shrunk to seven. In 256   BC the princes of those states assumed the title of king, stopped paying homage to the   Chou king, and continued to fight for supremacy. The strongest of the seven states was   Ch'in.\nThe disruption caused by this prolonged warfare had a number of long-range   consequences. One was the rise of a new social group, the scholars (shi). They were   forerunners of the scholar-officials of the Chinese Empire, who became the most   influential group in China. In the Later Chou period, however, they were a relatively   small group of learned people. Often wandering from state to state in search of permanent   employment, the shi worked as tutors to the children of feudal princes and as advisers to   various state governments. The most famous of these scholarly shi was Confucius.\n5. CH'IN EMPIRE (221-206 BC)\nAfter nearly 900 years, the Chou Dynasty came to an end when the state of Ch'in, the   strongest of the seven surviving states, unified China and established the first empire in   221 BC. The Ch'in empire did not last long, but it left two enduring legacies: the name   China and the idea and structure of the empire. This heritage outlasted the Ch'in Dynasty   itself by more than 2,000 years. (See Ch'in Dynasty)\nThe first Ch'in emperor was called Ch'in Shih Huang Ti. The title of emperor was used   for the first time in Chinese history to set the Ch'in ruler apart--as the ruler of the   unified land--from the kings, the heads of the earlier, smaller states. The construction   of massive palaces and the ceremony of the court further enhanced the power of the emperor   by inspiring awe in the people.\nA centralized bureaucracy replaced the old feudal system. The empire was divided into   provinces and counties, which were governed by centrally appointed governors and   magistrates. The former ruling families who had inherited their places in the aristocracy   were uprooted and forced to live in the capital of Xianyang. Other centralizing policies   included census taking and standardization of the writing system and weights and measures.\nThe Ch'in army conducted massive military campaigns to complete the unification of the   empire and expand its territory. The Ch'in empire stretched from the Mongolian plateau in   the north to Vietnam in the south. As with rulers before and after him, the first emperor   was preoccupied with defending his territory against northern nomads. After waging several   successful campaigns, the emperor ordered the building of the wall of \"ten thousand   li\" (a li is a Chinese unit of distance) to protect the empire. This task involved   connecting the separate walls that were built by former northern states to form the famous   Great Wall. The Ten Thousand Li Wall, as it is known in China, is 1,500 miles (2,400   kilometers) long, from 15 to 50 feet (5 to 15 meters) high, and from 15 to 25 feet (5 to 8   meters) wide. Although closely linked with the first ruler of the Ch'in Empire, the wall   as it stands today dates mainly from the later Ming Dynasty.\nCh'in Shih Huang Ti's harsh rule provoked much opposition. The emperor feared the   scholars most. He had them rounded up and put them to death or sent them into exile. Many   went into hiding. Moreover, all books, except technical ones, were confiscated and burned.   In the last years of his life, Ch'in Shih Huang Ti became fearful of threats on his life   and lived in complete secrecy. He also became obsessed with obtaining immortality. He died   in 210 BC in Shandong Province, far from the capital of Xianyang, during one of his long   quests to find the elixir of life.\nThe Ch'in empire disintegrated rapidly after the death of the first emperor. The   legitimate heir was killed in a palace intrigue, and a less able prince was put on the   throne. Conditions worsened throughout the empire. In 209 BC, rebellions erupted all over   China. Two men had the largest following. Hsiang Yu was a general of aristocratic   background; Liu Pang was a minor official from a peasant family. By 206 BC rebels had   subdued the Ch'in army and destroyed the capital. The struggle between Hsiang Yu and Liu   Pang continued for the next four years, however, until Liu Pang emerged as the victor in   202 BC. Taking the title of Kao Tsu, High Progenitor, he established the Han Dynasty.\n6. THE HAN EMPIRE (202 BC-AD 220)\nThe four-century-long Han rule is divided into two periods: the Earlier or Western Han   and the Later or Eastern Han. In between these two was the short-lived Hsin Dynasty (AD   9-23).\nEarlier (Western) Han (202 BC-AD 9).\nThe Han Kao Tsu preserved many features of the Ch'in imperial system, such as the   administrative division of the country and the central bureaucracy. But the Han rulers   lifted the Ch'in ban on philosophical and historical writings. Han Kao Tsu called for the   services of men of talent, not only to restore the destroyed classics but to serve as   officials in the government. From that time, the Chinese Empire was governed by a body of   officials theoretically selected on merit. Such a practice has few parallels elsewhere at   this early date in human history.\nIn 124 BC, during the reign of Wu Ti (140-87, the Martial Emperor), an imperial   university was set up for the study of Confucian classics. The university recruited   talented students, and the state supported them. Starting with 50 when the university   first opened, the number of government-supported students reached 30,000 by the end of the   Han Dynasty. Emperor Wu also established Confucianism as the official doctrine of the   state. This designation lasted until the end of the Chinese Empire.\nThe Early Han faced two major difficulties: invasions by the barbarian Huns and the   influence of the imperial consort families. In the Han Dynasty, the Huns (known as   Hsiung-nu by the Chinese) threatened the expanding Chinese Empire from the north. Starting   in Wu Ti's reign, costly, almost century-long campaigns had to be carried out to establish   Chinese sovereignty along the northern and northwestern borders. Wu Ti also waged   aggressive campaigns to incorporate northern Korea in 108 BC and northern Annam in 111 BC   into the Han empire. The Early Han's other difficulty started soon after the first   emperor's death. The widowed Empress Lu dominated politics and almost succeeded in taking   the throne for her family. Thereafter, families of the empresses exerted great political   influence. In AD 9 Wang Mang, a nephew of the empress, seized the throne and founded a new   dynasty of Hsin.\nWang Mang's overambitious reform program alienated him from the landlords. At the same   time the peasants, disappointed with Wang's inability to push through the reform, rose in   rebellion. In AD 17 a rebel group in Shandong painted their faces red (hence their name,   Red Eyebrows) and adopted religious symbols, a practice later repeated by peasants who   rebelled in times of extreme difficulty. Wang Mang's force was defeated, and he was killed   in AD 23.\nLater (Eastern) Han (AD 23-220).\nThe new ruler who restored peace and order was a member of the house of Han, the   original Liu family. His title was Kuang Wu Ti, \"Shining Martial Emperor,\" from   AD 25 to 57. During the Later Han, which lasted another 200 years, a concerted but   unsuccessful effort was made to restore the glory of the former Han. The Later Han scored   considerable success in recovering lost territories, however. Sent to befriend the tribes   on the northwestern frontier in AD 73, a great diplomat-general, Pan Ch'ao, eventually led   an army of 70,000 almost to the borders of eastern Europe. Pan Ch'ao returned to China in   101 and brought back information about the Roman Empire. The Romans also knew about China,   but they thought of it only as the land where silk was produced.\nThe Later Han period was particularly plagued with evils caused by eunuchs, castrated   males recruited from the lower classes to serve as bodyguards for the imperial harem.   Coming from uneducated and poor backgrounds, they were ruthlessly ambitious once they were   placed within reach of power. Toward the end of the Later Han, power struggles between the   eunuchs and the landlord-officials were prolonged and destructive. Peasant rebellions of   the Taoist-leaning Yellow Turbans in 184 and the Five Pecks of Rice in 190 led to the rise   of generals who massacred over 2,000 eunuchs, destroyed the capital, and one after another   became dictators. By 207 General Ts'ao Ts'ao had emerged as dictator in the north. When he   died in 220 his son removed the powerless emperor and established the kingdom of Wei. The   Eastern Han came to an end, and the empire was divided into the three kingdoms of Wei, Shu   Han, and Wu. The pattern of the rise and fall of Han was to be repeated in later periods.   This characteristic came to be known as the dynastic cycle.\nHan culture.\nThe Chinese show their pride in Han accomplishments by calling themselves the Han   people. Philosophies and institutions that began in the Chou and Ch'in periods reached   maturity under the Han. During Han times, the Chinese distinguished themselves in making   scientific discoveries, many of which were not known to Westerners until centuries later.   The Chinese were most advanced in astronomy. They invented sundials and water clocks,   divided the day equally into ten and then into 12 periods, devised the lunar calendar that   continued to be used until 1912, and recorded sunspots regularly. In mathematics, the   Chinese were the first to use the place value system, whereby the value of a component of   a number is indicated by its placement. Other innovations were of a more practical nature:   wheelbarrows, locks to control water levels in streams and canals, and compasses.\nThe Han Chinese were especially distinguished in the field of art. The famous sculpture   of the \"Han flying horse\" and the carving of the jade burial suit found in Han   period tombs are only two superb examples. The technique of making lacquer ware was also   highly developed. The Chinese are proudest of the tradition of historical writing that   began in the Han period. Ssu-ma Ch'ien (145?-85? BC) was grand historian (an office that   combined the duties of court recorder and astronomer) during the time of Wu Ti. His   `Historical Records', which took ten years to complete, established the pattern and style   followed by subsequent histories. In the Later Han, the historical tradition was continued   by the Pan family. Pan Piao, the father, started to bring Ssu-ma Ch'ien's `Records' up to   date. The work was continued by his son Pan Ku (twin brother of the general Pan Ch'ao) and   was completed by his daughter Pan Chao, China's earliest and most famous woman scholar.   Unlike Ssu-ma Ch'ien, the Pan family limited their work to 230 years of the Early Han.   This was the first of the dynastic histories, subsequently written for every dynasty. Pan   Chao also wrote a highly influential work on the education of women, `Lessons for Women'.   `Lessons' emphasized the \"virtues\" of women, which restricted women's   activities. The Confucianism that the Han Dynasty restored differed from the original   teachings of Confucius. The leading Han philosophers, Tung Chung-shu and others, used   principles derived from the early Chinese philosophy of nature to interpret the ancient   texts. The Chinese philosophy of nature explained the workings of the universe by the   alternating forces of yin and yang--dark and light--and the five elements: earth, wood,   metal, fire, and water. The Han period was marked by a broad eclecticism. Many Han   emperors favored Taoism, especially the Taoist idea of immortality.\n7. THE PERIOD OF DISUNITY (220-581)\nAfter the fall of the Later Han, the Chinese Empire remained divided for three and a   half centuries. The first half-century began with the domination of the Three Kingdoms:   Wei under the Ts'ao family in the north, Shu Han under Liu Pei in the southwest, and Wu   under Sun Ch'uan in the southeast. Invaders from the north soon overran the kingdoms and   set up their own states, but the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534), established by one of the   barbarian tribes, the Toba, was the only one to last. Four dynasties established by the   Chinese ruled in the south during the 4th and 5th centuries. The Three Kingdoms period was   made famous by the novel `Romance of the Three Kingdoms', which glamorized the period as   an age of chivalry.\n8. THE SUI DYNASTY (581-618).\nThe prolonged period of disunity finally ended when a general from the northwest united   China by establishing the new dynasty of Sui. A second great period of imperial unity was   begun. The relationship of the Sui to the succeeding T'ang Dynasty was much like that of   the Ch'in to the Han. It served as the unifying foundation on which its successor could   build. The first Sui emperor, Wen Ti, introduced a series of economic reforms, such as   reduction of the peasants' taxes, a careful census for equitable tax collection, and   restoration of the equal allocation system used in the Northern Wei. Every taxable male   received a grant of land, part of which was returnable when he ceased to be a taxpayer at   age 60 and part of which he could pass on to his heirs. He also revived the Han system of   examinations based on Confucian classics.\nSui Wen Ti's premature death might have been caused by his ambitious son Yang Ti, whose   grandiose projects and military campaigns ultimately led to the Sui's downfall. Some of   his projects were productive, especially the construction of the Grand Canal, which linked   up the Huang, Huai, and Yangtze rivers and connected north and south China.\nYang Ti's overly ambitious scheme of expanding his empire led to disastrous wars   against Korea. After a series of futile expeditions, the Chinese army of over a million   was defeated and forced to flee. In 618, Yang Ti was assassinated in an army coup; one of   the coup leaders, Li Shih-min, installed his father as emperor, founding the T'ang   Dynasty. After about a decade, during which he was able to secure his father's abdication,   he took the throne himself in 626 as the emperor T'ai Tsung.\n9. THE T'ANG DYNASTY (618-907).\nThe T'ang emperors set up a political system in which the emperor was supreme and   government officials were selected on the bases of merit and education. The early T'ang   rulers applied the equal allocation system rigorously to bring about a greater equity in   taxation and to insure the flow of taxes to the government. A census was taken every three   years to enforce the system, which also involved drafting people to do labor. These   measures led to an agricultural surplus and the development of units of uniform value for   the principal commodities, two of the most important prerequisites for the growth of   commerce and cities.\nThe T'ang capital of Chang'an was one of the greatest commercial and cosmopolitan   cities in the world at that time. Like most capitals of China, Chang'an was composed of   three parts: the palace, the imperial city, and the outer city, separated from each other   by mighty walls.\nThe T'ang was a period of great imperial expansion, which reached its greatest height   in the first half of the 8th century. At that time, Chinese control was recognized by   people from Tibet and Central Asia in the west to Mongolia, Manchuria (now the Northeast   region of China), and Korea in the\nnorth and Annam in the south.\nThe An Lu-shan rebellion.\nMost of the T'ang accomplishments were attained during the first century of the   dynasty's rule, through the early part of Emperor Hsuan Tsung's long reign from 712 to   756. However, late in his reign he neglected government affairs to indulge in his love of   art and study. This led to the rise of viceroys, commanders responsible for military and   civil affairs in the regions. An Lu-shan was a powerful viceroy commanding the northwest   border area. He had both connections at the imperial court and hidden imperial ambitions.   In 755 he rose in rebellion.\nThe emperor fled the capital with an ill-equipped army. These troops soon rebelled and   forced the emperor to abdicate in favor of his son.\nThe new emperor raised a new army to fight the rebels. An Lu-shan was assassinated in   757, but the war dragged on until 763. Afterward, the Chinese Empire virtually   disintegrated once again. The provinces remained under the control of various regional   commanders. The dynasty continued to linger on for another century, but the T'ang empire   never fully recovered the central authority, prosperity, and peace of its first century.\nThe most serious problem of the last century of T'ang was the rise of great landlords   who were exempt from taxation. Unable to pay the exorbitant taxes collected twice a year   after the An Lu-shan rebellion, peasants would place themselves under the protection of a   landlord or become bandits. Peasant uprisings, beginning with the revolt under the   leadership of Huang Ch'ao in the 870s, left much of central China in ruins.\nIn 881 Huang Ch'ao's rebels, now numbering over 600,000 people, destroyed the capital,   forcing the imperial court to move east to Luoyang. Another rebel leader founded a new   dynasty, called Later Liang, at Kaifeng in Henan Province in 907, but he was unable to   unify all China under his rule. This second period of disunity lasted only half a century.   Once again, however, China was divided between north and south, with five dynasties in the   north and ten kingdoms in the south.\nT'ang culture. Buddhist influence in art, especially in sculpture, was strong   during the T'ang period. Fine examples of Buddhist sculpture are preserved in rock   temples, such as those at Yongang and Longmen in northwest China. The invention of   printing and improvements in papermaking led to the printing of a whole set of Buddhist   sutras (discourses of the Buddha) by 868. By the beginning of the 11th century all of the   Confucian classics and the Taoist canon had been printed. In secular literature, the T'ang   is especially well known for poetry. The great T'ang poets such as Li Po and Tu Fu were   nearly all disillusioned officials.\nThe T'ang period marked the beginnings of China's early technological advancement over   other civilizations in the fields of shipbuilding and firearms development. Both reached   new heights in the succeeding dynasty of Sung.\nPapermaking; Firearms By the 13th century papermaking spread throughout Europe.   Paper was a Chinese invention. It had been adopted by the Persians and then by the Arabs,   who brought the art to Europe. (See Paper)\nPowder (not gunpowder, because guns were not yet known) and fireworks rockets were   introduced into Europe in the 1200s. They had been invented in China some years earlier.\nThe earliest mention of firearms is in a Dutch chronicle dated 1313. It states that   firearms were invented in Germany. The first picture of a primitive cannon can be found in   an English manuscript dated 1326. (See Rocket; Explosive; Firearms)\n10. THE SUNG DYNASTY (960-1279)\nOver 300 years of Sung history is divided into the two periods of Northern and Southern   Sung. Because of the barbarian occupation of northern China the second half of the Sung   rule was confined to the area south of the Huai River.\nNorthern Sung (960-1126). General Chao K'uang-yin, later known as Sung T'ai Tsu,   was said to have been coerced to become emperor in order to unify China. Wary of   power-hungry commanders, Sung T'ai Tsu made the military into a national army under his   direct control. Under his less capable successors, however, the military increasingly lost   prestige. Unfortunately for China, the weakening of the military coincided with the rise of successive strong nomad nations on the borders.\nIn contrast to the military's loss of prestige, the civil service rose in dignity. The   examination system that had been restored in the Sui and T'ang was further elaborated and   regularized. Selection examinations were held every three years at the district,   provincial, and metropolitan levels.\nOnly 200 out of thousands of applicants were granted the jinshi degree, the highest   degree, and appointed to government posts. From this time on, civil servants became   China's most envied elite, replacing the hereditary nobles and landlords.\nSung dominion extended over only part of the territories of earlier Chinese empires.   The Khitans controlled the northeastern territories, and the Hsi Hsia (Western Hsia)   controlled the northwestern territories. Unable to recover these lands, the Sung emperors   were compelled to make peace with the Khitans in 1004 and with the Hsi Hsia in 1044.   Massive payments to the barbarians under the peace terms depleted the state treasury,   caused hardship to taxpaying peasants, and gave rise to a conflict in the court among   advocates of war, those who favored peace, and reformers.\nIn 1069 Emperor Shen Tsung appointed Wang An-shih as chief minister. Wang proposed a   number of sweeping reforms based on the classical text of the `Rites of Chou'. Many of his \"new laws\" were actually revivals of earlier policies, but officials and   landlords opposed his reforms. When the emperor and Wang died within a year of each other,   the new laws were withdrawn. For the next several decades, until the fall of the Northern   Sung in 1126, the reformers and antireformers alternated in power, creating havoc and   turmoil in government.\nIn an effort to regain territory lost to the Khitans, the Sung sought an alliance with   the newly powerful Juchens from Manchuria. Once the alliance had expelled the Khitans,   however, the Juchens turned on the Sung and occupied the capital of Kaifeng. The Juchens   established the dynasty of Chin, a name meaning \"gold,\" which lasted from 1115   to 1234, in the north. They took the emperor and his son prisoner, along with 3,000   others, and ordered them to be held in Manchuria.\nSouthern Sung (1126-1279). Another imperial son fled south and settled in 1127   at Hangzhou, where he resumed the Sung rule as the emperor Kao Tsung. The Sung retained   control south of the Huai River, where they ruled for another one and a half centuries.\nAlthough militarily weak and limited in area, the Southern Sung represented one of   China's most brilliant periods of cultural, commercial, maritime, and technological   development. Despite the loss of the north, trade continued to expand, enabling a   commercial revolution to take place in the 13th century. Cut off from the traditional   overland trade routes, Sung merchants turned to the ocean with the aid of such   improvements as compasses and huge oceangoing ships called junks. The development of a   paper money economy stimulated commercial growth and kept it going.\nEnd of the Southern Sung. While the Sung ruling class and the imperial court   indulged themselves in art and luxurious living in the urban centers, the latest nomad   empire arose in the north. The formidable Mongol armies, conquerors of Eurasia as far west   as eastern Europe and of Korea in the east, descended on the Southern Sung.\nCulture in the Sung period.\nThe Sung period was noted for landscape painting, which in time came to be considered   the highest form of classical art. The city-dwelling people of the Sung period   romanticized nature. This romanticism, combined with a mystical, Taoist approach to nature   and a Buddhist-inspired contemplative mood, was reflected in landscape paintings showing   people dwarfed by nature.\nIn philosophy, the trend away from Buddhism and back to Confucianism, which had begun   in the late T'ang, continued. Pure and simple restoration of the ancient teaching was   impossible, however, because Confucianism had been challenged by Buddhism and Taoism.   Confucianism needed to explain humanity and the universe as well as to regulate human   relations within society. In the late T'ang and early Sung, several strands of   Confucianism emerged. The great scholar Chu Hsi synthesized elements of Confucianism,   Buddhism, and Taoism. This reconstituted philosophy became known as Neo-Confucianism, and   it was the orthodox state doctrine until the end of the imperial system. Chu Hsi's   philosophy was one that stressed dualism, the goodness of human nature, and   self-cultivation by education through the continuing \"investigation of things.\"\nThe Sung scholars and historians also attempted to synthesize history. Ssu-ma Kuang   made the first effort at producing a comprehensive history since Ssu-ma Ch'ien of the Han.   In 294 chapters, he wrote a chronological account of the period from 403 BC to AD 959,   which was abridged by Chu Hsi in the 12th century. Another first in Sung scholarship was   the creation of encyclopedias. `Assembled Essentials on the T'ang', a collection completed   in 961, became the example for the various types of encyclopedic literature that followed.\nThe Sung period is famous for porcelain with a celadon glaze, which was one of the most   desired items in foreign trade (See Pottery and Porcelain). The development of gunpowder   led to the invention of a type of hand grenade. In shipbuilding, the great seagoing junks   were admired and imitated by Arab and Western sailors. By far the largest ships in the   world at the time, they had watertight compartments and could carry up to 1,000   passengers.\nThe Sung cities. Oceanic and coastal trade was concentrated in large ports such   as Canton, Hangzhou, and Chuanzhou (Marco Polo's Zayton), where large foreign trading   communities developed. Koreans dominated the trade with the eastern islands, while   Persians and Arabs controlled commerce across the western seas. Along with commercial   expansion came the urbanization, or increasing importance of cities, in Sung society.   Hangzhou, the Southern Sung capital, had a population of more than 2 million.   Commercialization and urbanization had a number of effects on Chinese society. People in   the countryside faced the problems of absentee landlordism. Although many city residents   enjoyed luxury, with a great variety of goods and services, poverty was widespread.\nA change associated with urbanization was the decline in the status of women of the   upper classes. With the concentration of the upper classes in the cities, where the work   of women became less essential, women were treated as servants and playthings. This was   reflected in the practices of concubinage and of binding girls' feet to make them smaller.   Neither practice was banned until the 20th century.\n11. THE YUAN (Mongol) DYNASTY (1279-1368)\nThe Mongols were the first of the northern barbarians to rule all of China. After   creating an empire that stretched across the Eurasian continent and occupying northern   China and Korea in the first half of the 13th century, the Mongols continued their assault   on the Southern Sung. By 1276 the Southern Sung capital of Hangzhou had fallen, and in   1279 the last of the Sung loyalists perished.\nBefore this, Kublai Khan, the fifth \"great khan\" and grandson of Genghis   Khan, had moved the Mongol capital from Karakorum to Peking. In 1271 he declared himself   emperor of China and named the dynasty Yuan, meaning \"beginning,\" to signify   that this was the beginning of a long era of Mongol rule.\nIn Asia, Kublai Khan continued his grandfather's dream of world conquest. Two   unsuccessful naval expeditions were launched against Japan in 1274 and 1281. Four land   expeditions were sent against Annam and five against Burma. However, the Mongol conquests   overseas and in Southeast Asia were neither spectacular nor were they long enduring.\nMongol rule in China lasted less than a century. The Mongols became the most hated of   the barbarian rulers because they did not allow the Chinese ruling class to govern.   Instead, they gave the task of governing to foreigners. Distrusting the Chinese, the   Mongol rulers placed the southern Chinese at the lowest level of the four classes they   created. The extent of this distrust was reflected in their provincial administration. As   conquerers, they followed the Ch'in example and made the provincial governments into   direct extensions of the central chancellery. This practice was continued by succeeding   dynasties, resulting in a further concentration of power in the central imperial   government.\nThe Chinese despised the Mongols for refusing to adapt to Chinese culture. The Mongols   kept their own language and customs. The Mongol rulers were tolerant about religions,   however. Kublai Khan reportedly dabbled in many religions.\nThe Mongols and the West. The Mongols were regarded with mixed feelings in the   West. Although Westerners dreaded the Mongols, the Crusaders hoped to use them in their   fight against the Muslims and attempted to negotiate an alliance with them for this   purpose. Friar John of Carpini and William of Rubruck were two of the better known   Christian missionaries sent to establish these negotiations with the Mongol ruler.\nThe best account of the Mongols was left by a Venetian merchant, Marco Polo, in his   `Marco Polo's Travels'. It is an account of Polo's travels over the long and perilous land   route to China, his experience as a trusted official of Kublai Khan, and his description   of China under the Mongols. Dictated in the early 14th century, the book was translated   into many languages. Although much of medieval Europe did not believe Polo's tales, some,   like Christopher Columbus, were influenced by Polo's description of the riches of the   Orient. (See Kublai Khan; Mongol Empire; Polo, Marco)\nAfter the death of Kublai Khan in 1294, successive weak and incompetent khans made the   already hated Mongol rule intolerable. Secret societies became increasingly active, and a   movement known as the Red Turbans spread throughout the north during the 1350s. In 1356 a   rebel leader named Chu Yuan-chang and his peasant army captured the old capital of   Nanjing. Within a decade he had won control of the economically important middle and lower   reaches of the Yangtze River, driving the Mongols to the north. In 1368 he declared   himself the emperor Hung-wu and established his capital at Nanjing on the lower Yangtze.   Later the same year he captured the Yuan capital of Peking. (See Kublai Khan; Mongol   Empire)\nKublai Khan (1215-94). The founder of China's Yuan (Mongol) Dynasty was a   brilliant general and statesman named Kublai Khan. He was the grandson of the great Mongol   conqueror, Genghis Khan, and he was overlord of the vast Mongol Empire. The achievements   of Kublai Khan were first brought to the attention of Western society in the writings of   Marco Polo, the Venetian traveler who lived at the Chinese court for nearly 20 years (See   Polo, Marco).\nKublai Khan was born in 1215, the fourth son of Genghis Khan's fourth son. He began to   play a major role in the consolidation of Mongol power in 1251, when his brother, the   emperor Mongke, resolved to complete the conquest of China. He therefore vested Kublai   with responsibility for keeping order in conquered territory. After Mongke's death in   1259, Kublai had himself proclaimed khan. During the next 20 years he completed the   unification of China. He made his capital in what is now Beijing.\nKublai's major achievement was to reconcile China to rule by a foreign people, the   Mongols, who had shown little ability at governing. His failures were a series of costly wars, including two disastrous attempts to invade Japan; they brought little benefit to   China. Although he was a magnanimous ruler, Kublai's extravagant administration slowly   impoverished China; and in the 14th century the ineptitude of his successors provoked   rebellions that eventually destroyed the Mongol dynasty. (See Genghis Khan; Mongol Empire)\nPolo, Marco (1254-1323?). In 1298 a Venetian adventurer named Marco Polo wrote a   fascinating book about his travels in the Far East. Men read his accounts of Oriental   riches and became eager to find sea routes to China, Japan, and the East Indies. Even   Columbus, nearly 200 years later, often consulted his copy of `The Book of Ser Marco   Polo'.\nIn Marco's day the book was translated and copied by hand in several languages. After   printing was introduced in the 1440s, the book was circulated even more widely. Many   people thought that the book was a fable or a gross exaggeration. A few learned men   believed that Marco wrote truly, however, and they spread Marco's stories of faraway   places and unknown peoples. Today geographers agree that Marco's book is amazingly   accurate.\nMarco Polo was born in the city-republic of Venice in 1254. His father and uncles were   merchants who traveled to distant lands to trade. In 1269 Marco's father, Nicolo, and his   uncle Maffeo returned to Venice after being away many years. On a trading expedition they   had traveled overland as far as Cathay (China). Kublai Khan, the great Mongol emperor of   China, asked them to return with teachers and missionaries for his people. So they set out   again in 1271, and this time they took Marco.\nFrom Venice the Polos sailed to Acre, in Palestine. There two monks, missionaries to   China, joined them. Fearing the hard journey ahead, however, the monks soon turned back.   The Polos crossed the deserts of Persia (Iran) and Afghanistan. They mounted the heights   of the Pamirs, the \"roof of the world,\" descending to the trading cities of   Kashgar (Shufu) and Yarkand (Soche). They crossed the dry stretches of The Gobi. Early in   1275 they arrived at Kublai Khan's court at Cambaluc (Peking). At that time Marco was 21   years old.\nPolo at the Court of the Great Khan\nMarco quickly became a favorite of Kublai Khan. For three years he governed busy   Yangchow, a city of more than 250,000 people. He was sent on missions to far places in the   empire: to Indochina, Tibet, Yunnan, and Burma. From these lands Marco brought back   stories of the people and their lives.\nThe Polos became wealthy in Cathay. But they began to fear that jealous men in the   court would destroy them when the khan died. They asked to return to Venice. Kublai Khan   refused. Then came an envoy from the khan of Persia. He asked Kublai Khan for a young   Mongol princess for a bride. The Polos said that the princess' journey should be guarded   by men of experience and rank. They added that the mission would enable them to make the   long-desired visit to Venice. The khan reluctantly agreed.\nSince there was danger from robbers and enemies of the khan along the overland trade   routes, a great fleet of ships was built for a journey by sea. In 1292 the fleet sailed,   bearing the Polos, the princess, and 600 noblemen of Cathay. They traveled southward along   Indochina and the Malay Peninsula to\nSumatra. Here the voyage was delayed many months.\nThe ships then turned westward and visited Ceylon and India. They touched the East   African coast. The voyage was hazardous, and of the 600 noblemen only 18 lived to reach   Persia. The Polos and the princess were safe. When the Polos landed in Venice, they had   been gone 24 years. The precious stones they brought from Cathay amazed all Venice.\nLater Marco served as gentleman-captain of a ship. It was captured by forces of the   rival trading city of Genoa, and he was thrown into a Genoese prison. There he wrote his   book with help from another prisoner. Marco was released by the Genoese in 1299. He   returned to Venice and engaged in trade. His name appears in the court records of his time   in many lawsuits over property and money. He married and had three daughters. He died   about 1323.\n12. THE MING DYNASTY (1368-1644)\nHaving restored Chinese rule to China, the first Ming emperor tried to model his rule   after that of the Han, but the Ming fell far short of the Han's accomplishments. The land   under Ming domination was less than under either the Han or the T'ang. The Ming dominion   changed little after the first two decades. It was confined mostly to what is known as   China proper, south of the Great Wall and east of Xinjiang and Tibet.\nIn culture, as well, the Ming lacked the Han's creativity and brilliance. Coming after   almost a century of foreign domination, the Ming was a period of restoration and   reorganization rather than a time of new discovery. In a sense, the Ming followed a   typical dynastic cycle: initial rehabilitation of the economy and restoration of efficient   government, followed by a time of stability and then a gradual decline and fall.\nThe emperor Hung-wu modeled his government on the T'ang system, restoring the doctrine   and practices of Confucianism and continuing the trend toward concentration of power in   the imperial government, especially in the hands of the emperor himself. He tried to   conduct state affairs singlehandedly, but the work load proved overwhelming. To assist   him, he gathered around him several loyal middle-level officials, thus creating an   extra-governmental organization, the Grand Secretariat. The central bureaucracy was   restored and filled by officials selected by the examination system. That system was   further formalized by the introduction of a special essay style called the eight-legged   essay, to be used in writing the examination. In addition, the subject matter of the examinations was restricted to the Five Classics, said to have been compiled, edited, or   written by Confucius, and the Four Books, published by Chu Hsi.\nIn the field of provincial government, the emperor Hung-wu continued the Yuan practice   of limiting the power of provincial governors and subjecting them directly to the central   government. The empire was divided into 15 provinces. The first capital at Nanjing was in   the economic heartland of China, but in 1421 the emperor Yung-Lo, who took the throne   after a civil w ar, moved the capital to Peking, where he began a massive construction   project. The imperial palace, which is also known as the Forbidden City, was built at this   time.\nThe Ming produced two unique contributions: the maritime expeditions of the early 15th   century and the philosophy of Wang Yang-ming. Between 1405 and 1433, seven major maritime   expeditions were launched under the leadership of a Muslim eunuch, Cheng Ho. Each   expedition was provided with several seagoing vessels, which were 400 feet (122 meters)   high, weighed 700 tons (635 metric tons), had multiple decks and 50 or 60 cabins, and   carried several hundred people. During these expeditions, the Chinese sailed the South   Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf. They traveled as far west as   eastern Africa and as far south as Java and Sumatra. But these missions ended just as   suddenly as they had begun.\nIn philosophy, Wang Yang-ming developed a system of thought that ran counter to the   orthodox teaching of Chu Hsi. While Chu Hsi believed in learning based on reason and the \"investigation of things,\" Wang Yang-ming believed in the \"learning of the   mind,\" an intuitive process.\nDuring the second half of the Ming Dynasty, European expansion began. Early in the 16th   century Portuguese traders arrived and leased the island of Macao as their trading post.   In 1582 Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit missionary, arrived in Macao. Because of his   knowledge of science, mathematics, and astronomy and his willingness to learn the Chinese   language and adapt to Chinese life, he was accepted by the Chinese and became the first   foreigner allowed to live in Peking permanently. Jesuits followed him and served the Ming   emperors as mapmakers, calendar reformers, and astronomers.\nUnlike earlier brief contacts with the West or the later Western incursions into China,   the 16th-century Sino-Western relationship was culturally oriented and mutually   respectful. Both the Chinese and the Jesuits tried to find common ground in their   thoughts. The Jesuits' activities produced 300,000 converts in 200 years, not a great   number among a population of more than 100 million. Among them, however, were noted   scholars such as Hsu Kuang-ch'i and Li Chih-tsao, who translated many of the works that   Jesuits brought to China. The Jesuits wrote over 300 Chinese works.\nIn the last century of its existence, the Ming Dynasty faced numerous internal and   external problems. The internal problem was tied to official corruption and taxation.   Because the Ming bureaucracy was relatively small, tax collection was entrusted to locally   powerful people who evaded paying taxes by passing the burden on to the poor. A succession   of weak and inattentive emperors encouraged the spread of corruption and the greed of   eunuchs. In the 1620s a struggle between the inner group of eunuchs and the outer circle   of scholar-officials led to the execution of about 700 scholars.\nExternally, the security of the Ming empire was threatened from all directions. The   Mongols returned and seized Peking in 1550, and their control of Turkestan and Tibet was   recognized by the Ming in a peace treaty of 1570. Pirates preyed on the east coast, and   Japanese pirates penetrated as far inland as Hangzhou and Nanjing. In the 1590s the Ming   had to send expeditionary forces to rescue Korea from invading Japanese soldiers under   Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The Ming drove back the Japanese forces, but not without depleting the   treasury and weakening their defensive network against neighboring Manchuria to the   northeast.\nIn Manchuria the Manchus (Pinyin: Manzhous) had organized a Chinese-style state and   strengthened their forces under a unique form of military organization called the banner   system. However, it was not the Manchus who overthrew the Ming but a Chinese rebel, Li   Tzu-cheng, who became a leader among the bandits who had become desperate because of a   famine in the northwest in 1628. By 1642 Li had become master of north China and in 1644   he captured Peking.\nThere he found that the last Ming emperor had hanged himself, ending the \"Brilliant\" dynasty. Li, however, was not destined to rule. The rule was to pass   once again into the hands of a people from beyond the Great Wall, the Manchus. They were   invited into China by the Ming general Wu San-kuei to eliminate the rebels. After driving   the rebels from the capital, the Manchus stayed and established a new dynasty, the Ch'ing.\n13. THE CHING DYNASTY (1644-1911)\nLike the Mongols in the 13th century, the Manchus (formerly the Juchen) were barbarians   who succeeded in ruling the whole of China, but, unlike the 13th-century conquerers, the   sinicized Manchus made their rule more acceptable to the Chinese. As a result, Ch'ing rule   lasted 267 years, compared with 89 years for the Yuan.\nThe Pax Sinica 1683-1795\nThe Manchus took Peking with relative ease in 1644, but they did not gain control of   the whole of China until 1683. Thereafter, the Manchus enjoyed more than a century of   peace and prosperity, a period that came to be called Pax Sinica (Peace in China). By the   end of that period the dynasty had reached the height of its power.\nTwo strong emperors who were considered models of all Confucian ideals ruled for much   of this period: the emperors K'ang-hsi (1661-1722) and Ch'ien-lung (1735-96). By   recruiting the well-educated in government and promoting Confucian scholarship, these two   Manchu rulers firmly established themselves as Confucian rulers in China. Outside China,   both were successful conquerers. All of the Ch'ing empire's vast territories, including   Mongolia in the north, Xinjiang in the northwest, and Tibet in the southwest, were   incorporated into the expanding Chinese Empire during this period.\nThe Ch'ing adopted the Ming system of government with two exceptions: the insertion of   Manchu power at the head of the Chinese state, and the creation of the Grand Council in   the emperor Yung-cheng's reign. The Grand Council superseded the Grand Secretariat and   became the most powerful body in the government. In provincial government, the Ch'ing   created 18 provinces from the 15 Ming provinces. A governor, usually Chinese, headed each   province, and a governor-general, usually a Manchu before the 19th century, headed every   two provinces. Local landlords and administrators were generally left alone if they   submitted to the new rule.\nThe K'ang-hsi era marked the height of Jesuit success in China, with more than 200,000   converts. Thereafter, Jesuit influence waned rapidly because of the rivalry between the   Jesuits and other Catholic missionaries and the so-called Rites Controversy, which   concerned the Jesuits' willingness to tolerate the converts' performance of ceremonies   honoring Confucius. The pope denounced the Jesuit view and prohibited the ceremonies.\nThe long period of peace and prosperity had some adverse effects on Chinese society.   There was a shortage of land, resulting from an increase in the population from 100   million to 300 million at the end of the 18th century. Decadence and corruption spread in   the imperial court. There was a decline of the Manchu military spirit, and the Ch'ing   military organization deteriorated. The long and illustrious reign of the emperor   Ch'ien-lung was marred by the first of many serious rebellions in the Ch'ing era, the   White Lotus Rebellion from 1796 to 1804. It was not put down for ten years, and China   entered the 19th century rocked by revolt. More devastating were the incursions of Western   powers, which shook the foundation of the empire. (See Ch'ien-lung)\n19th Century Invasions and rebellions.\nThe first of many Sino-Western conflicts in the 19th century was the first Opium War,   fought from 1839 to 1842. It was more than a dispute over the opium trade in China; it was   a contest between China as the representative of ancient Eastern civilization and Britain   as the forerunner of the modern West. Free trade advocates in the West had protested   against the restrictive trading system in force at Canton. They demanded free trade in   China, the opening of more ports to Westerners, and the establishment of treaty relations.   The Treaty of Nanjing, which ended the first Opium War, opened five ports to the   British--the first of the \"treaty ports\" where Western nations were granted   various privileges. A second Opium War, also known as the Arrow War, fought from 1856 to   1860, pitted China against Great Britain and France.\nThe Opium Wars disrupted the old life and economy of southern China. A number of   peasant revolts occurred in the 1840s, coming to a head in the Taiping Rebellion, the   biggest rebellion in Chinese history. The leader of the Taipings was Hung Hsiu-ch'uan,   from a village near Canton. Believing that God had chosen him to save the world, he   adopted a confused version of Christianity as his guiding doctrine and set out to   overthrow the Manchus and change society. The combination of religious fervor and   anti-Manchu sentiment attracted a following that rose to over 30,000 within a short time.   In 1852 the T'ai-p'ing T'ienkuo (Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace) was proclaimed. In 1853   the rebels took the city of Nanjing and made it their capital.\nOther revolts erupted at about the same time: the Nien Rebellion in the northeast and   Muslim rebellions in the southwest and the northwest. Fearing a linkup among the rebels   that would engulf all of China, the Ch'ing government created regional armies manned   entirely by Chinese and commanded by Chinese of the scholar-gentry class. The commanders   of the new forces, all loyal supporters of the dynasty--Tseng Kuo-fan, Tso Tsung-t'ang,   and Li Hung-chang--suppressed the rebels with the help of Western weapons and leadership.   They annihilated the Taipings in 1864, the Niens by 1868, and the Muslims by 1873.\nThe internal rebellions were suppressed, but external threats continued. After a brief   period of \"cooperation\" in the 1860s, foreign powers renewed their assault on   China, reacting to widespread antiforeign violence. Again, China became embroiled in a   series of conflicts: the Tianjin Massacre with France in 1870, the Ili crisis with Russia   in 1879, the Sino-French War from 1884 to 1885, and the Sino-Japanese War from 1894 to   1895. Each brought further humiliation and greater impairment of sovereignty. In the last   two incidents territory was lost, and an indemnity had to be paid to the victor\nin the Sino-Japanese War.\nOpium Wars\nChina in the 19th century was beset by internal turmoil. It was easy prey to more   powerful nations that wanted to exploit every advantage to profit from trade. Chief among   these advantages was the opium trade. Official Chinese resistance to opium resulted in two   trade wars in which Great Britain, France, the United States, and Russia gained   significant commercial privileges. These conflicts were the first Opium War from 1839 to   1842 between China and Britain and the second Opium War (1856-60) fought by China against   Britain and France.\nOpium had been introduced into China in the 7th century. By the early 18th century   opium addiction had become such a severe problem that the government tried to prohibit   trade in it. The prohibition was a failure. When the British discovered the value of the   opium trade in 1773, they determined to benefit. The Chinese paid the British for the   opium, and the British in turn used the money as part payment for goods bought from the   Chinese.\nIn 1839 the Chinese government made a concerted effort to suppress the opium trade. All   the opium warehouses in Canton were confiscated. This serious effort, followed by a minor   military incident, led to hostilities. In February 1840 the British sent an expedition   against Canton.\nThe conflict, in which the more powerful British were victorious, was ended by the   Treaty of Nanjing, which was signed on Aug. 29, 1842, and a supplemental treaty of Oct. 8,   1843. These treaties provided for payment of an indemnity of 21 million dollars by the   Chinese, cession of five ports for British trade and residence, and the right of British   citizens in China to be tried in British courts. It was at this time that Britain gained   control of Hong Kong.\nIn October 1856 the Canton police boarded a British-registered ship, the Arrow, and   charged its crew with smuggling. This incident led to the second war. In this war the   British were joined by the French, and an Anglo-French force occupied Canton late in 1857.   The Treaty of Tianjin in 1858 temporarily halted the fighting, opened new trading ports,   allowed residence in Peking for foreign emissaries, gave freedom of movement to Christian   missionaries, and permitted travel in the interior.\nThe Chinese refusal to ratify the treaty led to an Anglo-French attack on Peking and   the burning of the Summer Palace. In 1860 the Chinese signed the Convention of Peking by   which they promised to observe the 1858 treaty.\nTaiping Rebellion\nIn terms of casualties, it was one of the worst civil wars in history. More than 20   million--possibly more than 30 million--died, and 17 provinces were ravaged by the Taiping   Rebellion. This was the most serious of several internal disturbances that took place in   China between 1850 and 1873 and that seriously weakened the Ch'ing Dynasty and helped   prepare the way for the revolutions of the 20th century.\nThe leader of the rebellion was Hung Hsiu-ch'uan, an unsuccessful civil-service   candidate who came under the influence of fundamentalist Christianity. Thinking of himself   as a son of God sent to reform China, he helped found the Association of God Worshipers in   about 1846. Preaching that all property should be held by the people, he attracted many   followers in Guangxi Province. By January 1851, when the rebellion began, Hung's ranks had   swelled from several thousand ragged peasants to more than 1 million disciplined and eager   soldiers. They took the city of Nanjing in March 1853 and made it their capital. For   several years the rebel armies dominated the Yangtze River valley. They failed, however,   to take Shanghai, where the defenders were commanded by an American named Frederick   Townsend Ward and the British general known as Chinese Gordon . By 1862 the movement was   losing steam, weakened by internal strife and defections. Nanjing fell in July 1864 to the   army of Gen. Tseng Kuo-fan, and Hung committed suicide. Sporadic resistance continued for   four more years.\nLate 19th Century Revolutionary ideas and organizations.\nThe reforms that were sponsored by the imperial government were too little and too   late. A drastic change was necessary. The idea of overthrowing the Manchus was suggested   by Liang Ch'i-ch'ao in his concept of hsin min (new people). Publishing a magazine in   Japan, where he had fled after the Hundred Days, Liang called for the Chinese people to   renew themselves and also indicated that the Chinese nation was distinct and separate from   the ruling dynasty of the Manchus. Although he did not advocate overthrowing the dynasty,   the message was quickly picked up by the more radical leaders who were already leaning   toward revolution.\nOne such leader was Sun Yat-sen, who is now revered as the father of modern China by   Nationalists and Communists alike. Born into a peasant family near Canton, the traditional   stronghold of anti-Manchu rebels, Sun followed a traditional Chinese path during his early   years. He was educated in Hawaii, converted to Christianity, and had a short-lived medical   career before switching to politics and attempting to propose a reform program to Li   Hung-chang in 1894. After forming a secret revolutionary society and plotting an   unsuccessful uprising in Canton in 1894, Sun began a long period of exile outside China.   He gained wide recognition as a revolutionary leader in 1896, when his arrest in the   Chinese legation in London and subsequent rescue were reported sensationally in newspaper   articles.\nIn 1905, in Japan, he brought together several revolutionary groups and formed the   Revolutionary Alliance Society. Its program consisted of the now famous Three People's   Principles: nationalism, freeing all China from foreign control; democracy, overthrowing   the Manchus and introducing a democratic political system; and people's livelihood.   Although Sun himself could not live in China, members of the alliance infiltrated many   social organizations there. The revolutionary spirit that had been developed by Sun became   especially high among students' and soldiers' groups.\nThe Empress Dowger\nTZ'U-HSI (1835-1908). Known in the West as the empress dowager, Tz'u-hsi dominated the   political life of China for nearly 50 years. As ruler acting for child emperors, she and   her cohorts brought a measure of stability to their nation. But, under her, the government   was dishonest and did not make changes that were needed to benefit the people. This   eventually led to the end of the Ch'ing Dynasty, which ruled from 1644 to 1911, and a   revolution.\nTz'u-hsi was born in Peking on Nov. 29, 1835. She became a consort of the emperor   Hsien-feng (ruled 1850-61) and mother of the emperor T'ung-chih. When T'ung-chih became   emperor in 1861, he was only 6. She and another consort became co-regents along with a   brother of the former emperor. Under this three-way rule the Taiping Rebellion was ended.   Other disturbances were put down, and some modernization was brought to China.\nTz'u-hsi gradually increased her power within the ruling coalition, and even when the   emperor matured she continued to control the government. After the young emperor's   untimely death, she saw to it that her 3-year-old nephew was named as heir, though this   violated succession law. Thus the two owagers\ncontinued acting as regents. The other dowager died--presumably murdered--in 1881, and   Tz'u-hsi ruled alone. From 1889 to 1898 she lived in apparent retirement in the summer   palace. The new emperor's attempts at reform after losing the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95),   however, brought her back into action--determined to stave off any changes. In 1899 she   backed the officials promoting the Boxer Rebellion. After China's defeat at the hand of   foreign troops, she fled the capital and accepted humiliating peace terms. She returned in   1902 and belatedly tried to install the reforms she had once opposed. Before her death, on   Nov. 15, 1908, she had the emperor poisoned. His successor was a 2-year old who was forced   from the throne four years later.\nBoxer Rebellion\nIn the summer of 1900 members of a secret society roamed northeastern China in bands,   killing Europeans and Americans and destroying buildings owned by foreigners. They called   themselves I-ho ch'uan, or \"Righteous and Harmonious Fists.\" They practiced   boxing skills that they believed made them impervious to bullets. To Westerners they   became known as the Boxers, and their uprising was called the Boxer Rebellion.\nMost Boxers were peasants or urban thugs from northern China who resented the growing   influence of Westerners in their land. They organized themselves in 1898, and in the same   year the Chinese government--then ruled by the Ch'ing Dynasty--secretly allied with the   Boxers to oppose such outsiders as Christian missionaries and European businessmen. The   Boxers failed to drive foreigners out of China, but they set the stage for the successful   Chinese revolutionary movement of the early 20th century.\nForeigners had entered China during an era of imperialism. In the late 1800s Great   Britain and other European nations, the United States, Russia, and Japan scrambled for   spheres of influence there. In some cases they seized Chinese territories, but usually   they only sought the riches of trade and commercial enterprise. At the same time, Roman   Catholic and Protestant missionaries tried to convert the Chinese to Christianity. These   outsiders were resented and feared by the Chinese, who saw Western religion and business   practices as a threat to their traditional ways.\nBy May of 1900, Boxers were wandering the countryside and attacking Western   missionaries and Chinese converts to Christianity. In June an expeditionary force, made up   of Russian, British, German, French, American, and Japanese troops, was organized to   proceed to Peking (now Beijing), put\ndown the rebellion, and protect Western nationals.\nThe Chinese dowager empress Tz'u-hsi, the aunt of Emperor Kuang-hsu, ordered her troops   to block the advance of this expedition. The foreigners were turned back. Meanwhile,   Boxers were rampaging in Peking, burning down churches and the houses of Westerners, and   killing Chinese Christians. Foreign troops then seized Chinese coastal forts to insure   access to Peking. Enraged, the dowager empress ordered the death of all foreigners in   China. The German minister to China was assassinated, and Boxer rebels began an eight-week   attack on the walled foreign compound in Peking. (See Tz'u-hsi)\nIn response, the allied foreign governments sent some 19,000 soldiers to Peking,   capturing the city on Aug. 14, 1900. The invaders looted the city and routed the Boxers,   while the empress and her court fled to the north. By the time the rebellion ended, at   least 250 foreigners had been killed. It took a year for the parties to the conflict to   agree on a settlement, which was entitled the Peace of Peking. This protocol, which was   signed in September 1901, was dictated by the Western powers and Japan in such a way as to   humiliate China. Heavy fines were levied against the Chinese government, and existing   commercial treaties were amended in favor of the Western powers. The foreign coastal   defenses were dismantled.\nThe failure of the Boxer Rebellion to eject the West and the humiliation of the Chinese   by the terms of the Peace of Peking generated more support for nationalist   revolutionaries. In 1911 the Ch'ing Dynasty collapsed. Revolutionaries led by Dr. Sun   Yat-sen then took over the Chinese government,\nending more than 2,000 years of monarchy.\n14. THE CHINESE REVOLUTION I: NATIONALIST\nThe Revolution of 1911.\nIn the industrial city of Wuhan, a soldiers' groupwith only a loose connection to Sun's   alliance rose in rebellion in the early morning of Oct. 10, 1911 (since celebrated as   Double Ten, the tenth day of the tenth month). The Manchu governor and his commander fled,   and a Chinese ommander, Li Yuan-hung, was pressured into taking over the leadership. By   early December all of the central, southern, and northwestern provinces had declared   independence. Sun Yat-sen, who was in the United States during the revolution, returned   and was chosen head of the provisional government of the Republic of China in Nanjing.\nThe Manchu court quickly summoned Yuan Shih-kai, the former commander of the reformed   Northern Army. Personally ambitious and politically shrewd, Yuan carried out negotiations   with both the Manchu court and the revolutionaries. Yuan was able to persuade the Manchus   to abdicate peacefully in return for the safety of the imperial family. On Feb. 12, 1912,   the regent of the 6-year-old emperor formally announced the abdication. The Manchu rule in   China ended after 267 years, and with it the 2,000-year-old imperial system.\nTHE REPUBLIC OF CHINA (1912-1949)\nEarly in March 1912, Sun Yat-sen resigned from the presidency and, as promised, Yuan   Shih-kai was elected his successor at Nanjing. Inaugurated in March 1912 in Beijing, the   base of his power, Yuan established a republican system of government with a premier, a   cabinet, a draft constitution, and a plan for parliamentary elections early in 1913. The   Kuomintang (KMT, National People's party), the successor to Sun Yat-sen's organization,   was formed in order to prepare for the election.\nDespite his earlier pledges to support the republic, Yuan schemed to assassinate his   opponents and weaken the constitution and the parliament. By the end of 1914 he had made   himself president for life and even planned to establish an imperial dynasty with himself   as the first emperor. His dream was thwarted by the serious crisis of the Twenty-one   Demands for special privileges presented by the Japanese in January 1915 and by vociferous   opposition from many sectors of Chinese society. He died in June 1916 a broken man. After   Yuan's death, a number of his proteges took positions of power in the Beijing government   or ruled as warlords in outlying regions. In August 1917 the Beijing government joined the   Allies and declared war on Germany. At the peace conference in Versailles, France, the   Chinese demand to end foreign concessions in China was ignored.\nSun-yat Sen (1866-1925). Known as the father of modern China, Sun Yat-sen worked to achieve his lofty goals for modern China. These included the overthrow of the Manchu   Dynasty, the unification of China, and the establishment of a republic.\nSun Yat-sen was born on Nov. 12, 1866, in Guangdong Province and attended several   schools, including one in Honolulu, Hawaii, before transferring to a college of medicine   in Hong Kong. Graduating in 1892, Sun almost immediately abandoned medicine for politics.   His role in an unsuccessful uprising in Canton in 1895 prompted Sun to begin an exile that   lasted for 16 years. Sun used this time to travel widely in Japan, Europe, and the United   States, enlisting sympathy and raising money for his republican cause. Sun returned to   China in 1911 after a successful rebellion in Wuhan inspired uprisings in other provinces.   As leader of the Kuomintang, or Nationalist party, Sun was elected provisional president   of the newly declared republic but was forced to resign in 1912.\nIn 1913 his disagreements with government policies led Sun to organize a second   revolution. Failing to regain power, Sun left once again for Japan, where he organized a   separate government. Sun returned to China and attempted to set up a new government in   1917 and 1921 before successfully installing himself as generalissimo of a new regime in   1923.\nSun increasingly relied on aid from the Soviet Union, and in 1924 he reorganized the   Kuomintang on the model of the Soviet Communist party. Sun also founded the Whampoa   Military Academy and appointed Chiang Kai-shek as its president. Sun summarized his   policies in the Three Principles of the People--nationalism, democracy, and socialism. He   died of cancer in Peking on March 12, 1925. Sun's tomb in Nanking is now a national   shrine.\nThe May Fourth Movement.\nAfter World War I The Chinese felt betrayed. Anger and frustration erupted in   demonstrations on May 4, 1919, in Beijing. Joined by workers and merchants, the movement   spread to major cities. The Chinese representative at Versailles refused to endorse the   peace treaty, but its provisions remained unchanged. Disillusioned with the West, many   Chinese looked elsewhere for help.\nThe May Fourth Movement, which grew out of the student uprising, attacked Confucianism,   initiated a vernacular style of writing, and promoted science. Scholars of international   stature, such as John Dewey and Bertrand Russell, were invited to lecture. Numerous   magazines were published to stimulate new thoughts. Toward the end of the movement's   existence, a split occurred among its leaders. Some, like Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-chao,   were beginning to be influenced by the success of the Russian Revolution of 1917, which   contrasted sharply with the failure of the 1911 Revolution in China to change the social   order and improve conditions. By 1920, people associated with the Comintern (Communist   International) were disseminating literature in China and helping to start Communist   groups, including one led by Mao Zedong. A meeting at Shanghai in 1921 was actually the   first party congress of the Communist Party of China (CCP).\nThe CCP was so small that the Soviet Union looked elsewhere for a viable political   ally. A Comintern agent, Adolph Joffe, was sent to China to approach Sun Yat-sen, who had   failed to obtain assistance from Great Britain or the United States. The period of   Sino-Soviet collaboration began with the Sun-Joffe Declaration of Jan. 26, 1923. The KMT   was recognized by the Soviet Union, and the Communists were admitted as members. With   Soviet aid, the KMT army was built up. A young officer, Chiang Kai-shek, was sent to   Moscow for training. Upon returning, he was put in charge of the Whampoa Military Academy,   established to train soldiers to fight the warlords, who controlled much of China S(See   Chiang Kai-shek). Zhou Enlai (also Chou En-lai) of the CCP was deputy director of the   academy's political department.\nSun Yat-sen, whose power base was in the south, had planned to send an expedition   against the northern warlords, but he died before it could get under way. Chiang Kai-shek,   who succeeded him in the KMT leadership, began the northern expedition in July 1926. The   Nationalist army met little resistance and by April 1927 had reached the lower Yangtze.   Meanwhile, Chiang, claiming to be a sincere follower of Sun Yat-sen, had broken with the   left-wing elements of the KMT. After the Nationalist forces had taken Shanghai, a   Communist-led general strike was suppressed with bloodshed. Following suppressions in   other cities, Chiang set up his own government at Nanjing on April 18, 1927. He professed   friendship with the Soviet Union, but by July 1927 he was expelling Communists from the   KMT. Some left-wingers left for the Soviet Union.\nThe northern expedition was resumed, and in 1928 Chiang took Peking. China was formally   unified. Nationalist China was recognized by the Western powers and supported by loans   from foreign banks.\nThe Nationalist Eera (1928-1937).\nThe Nationalist period began with high hopes and much promise. More could have been   accomplished had it not been for the problems of Comintern corruption and Japanese   aggression. In his efforts to combat them both, Chiang neglected the land reform needed to   improve the lives of the peasants. Driven from the cities, the Communists concentrated on   organizing the peasants in the countryside. On Nov. 1, 1931, they proclaimed the   establishment of the Chinese Soviet Republic in the southeastern province of Jiangxi, with   Mao Zedong as chairman. Here the first units of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red   Army were formed. While conducting guerrilla warfare in these regions, the soldiers   carried out an agrarian revolution that was based on Mao's premise that the best way to   win the conflict was to isolate the cities by gaining control of the countryside and the   food supply.\nA military man by temperament and training, Chiang sought to eliminate the Communists   by force. He defined his anti-Communist drive as \"internal pacification before   resistance to external attack,\" and he gave it more importance than opposition to the   increasingly aggressive Japanese. With arms and military advisers from Nazi Germany,   Chiang carried out a series of \"extermination campaigns\" that killed about a   million people between 1930 to 1934. Chiang's fifth campaign, involving over half a   million troops, almost annihilated the Communists. Faced with the dilemma of being totally   destroyed in Jiangxi or attempting an almost impossible escape, the Communists decided to   risk the escape. On Oct. 15, 1934, they broke through the tight KMT siege. Over 100,000   men and women set out on the Long March of about 6,000 miles (9,600 kilometers) through   China's most rugged terrain to find a new base in the northwest.\nIn the meantime, the Japanese had made steady inroads into China. The Mukden Incident   of 1931, through which Mukden was occupied by the Japanese, was initiated by Japanese   officers stationed along the South Manchurian Railway. This was followed by the occupation   of Manchuria and the creation of the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932. By the mid-1930s   the Japanese had seized Inner Mongolia and parts of northeastern China and had created the   North China Autonomous Region with no resistance from the Nationalists. Anti-Japanese   sentiment mounted in China, but Chiang ignored it and in 1936 launched yet another   extermination campaign against the Communists in Shaanxi. Chiang was forced to give up the   anti-Communist drive when his troops mutinied and arrested him as he arrived in Xi'an in   December 1936 to plan strategy. He was released after he agreed to form a united front   with the CCP against the Japanese, who were making steady inroads into China.\nIn China, World War II broke out on July 7, 1937, with a seemingly insignificant little   battle between Chinese and Japanese troops near Peking, called the Marco Polo Bridge   Incident. Within a few days, the Japanese had occupied Peking, and the fighting spread   rapidly. The war in China fell into three stages. The first (1937-1939) was characterized   by the phenomenally rapid Japanese occupation of most of China's east coast, including   such major cities as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Canton. The Nationalist government moved to   the interior, ultimately to Chongqing in Sichuan, and the Japanese established puppet   governments in Peking in 1937 and in Nanjing in 1940. The second stage (1939-1943) was a   period of waiting, as Chiang blockaded the Communists in the northwest (despite the united   front) and waited for help from the United States, which had declared war on Japan in   1941.\nIn the final stage (1944-1945), the United States provided massive assistance to   Nationalist China, but the Chongqing government, weakened by inflation, impoverishment of   the middle class, and low troop morale was unable to take full advantage of it. Feuds   among the KMT generals and between Chiang and his United States military adviser, General   Joseph Stilwell, further hampered the KMT.\nWhen Japanese defeat became a certainty in the spring of 1945, the Communists seemed in   a better position to take over from the Japanese garrisons than the KMT, which was far   away in the rear of the formation. A United States airlift of KMT troops enabled them to   occupy many cities, but the countryside stayed with the Communists.\nAfter the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, the Allied war effort moved to the   east. The Soviet Union joined the war against Japan at the end of July. On August 6 and 9   the United States dropped the world's first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of   Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On Aug. 14, 1945, the Japanese surrendered. In China, however,   civil war raged over who should take charge of the Japanese arms and equipment. At the end   of August an agreement was reached in Chongqing between a CCP delegation and the KMT, but   the truce was brief.\nIn January 1946 a cease-fire was negotiated by United States General George C.   Marshall. The Nationalist government returned to Nanjing, and China was recognized by the   new United Nations as one of the five great powers. The United States supplied the Chiang   government with an additional $2 billion ($1.5 billion had been spent for the war).   Although the KMT's dominance in weapons and supplies was enormous, it was kept under guard   in the cities, while the Communists held the surrounding countryside. As inflation soared,   both civilians and the military became demoralized. The CCP, sensing the national mood,   proposed a coalition government. The KMT refused, and fighting\nerupted again.\nThe short and decisive civil war that followed was resolved in two main places:   Manchuria and the Huai River area. Despite a massive airlift of KMT forces by the United   States, Manchuria was lost in October 1948 after 300,000 KMT forces surrendered to the   CCP. By the end of 1948 the KMT had lost over half a million men, more than two thirds of   whom had defected. In April 1949 the Communists moved south of the Yangtze.\nAfter the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai, KMT resistance evaporated. By the autumn, the   Communists had taken all mainland territories except Tibet. Chiang Kai-shek and a number   of his associates fled to the island of Taiwan, where they set up what they claimed was   the rightful government of China.\n15. THE CHINESE REVOLUTION II: COMMUNIST\nThe Communist Party\nThe Chinese Communist party is the primary political force in China. Unlike parties in   Western democracies, it is a tightly organized movement that controls and leads society at   all levels. The party sets policy and controls its execution through government officials   who are also party members. The effect is to make the government an organ of the party.\nAt the time of its founding in 1921, the Chinese Communist party focused on organizing   urban workers, but it achieved only limited success in this effort. Orthodox Marxism   expected the Communist Revolution to begin among industrial workers. However, Karl Marx   had developed his theories based upon highly industrialized economies, and the industrial   sector in China was small and relatively primitive. It was Mao Zedong who adapted Marxist   theory to the conditions of an underdeveloped, primarily agricultural society . Although   Mao's successors downgraded some of his more radical ideas, Marxism-Leninism-Mao   Thought--Marxism as it was interpreted by Mao--is still officially designated as the   guiding philosophy that is behind both the party and the government.\nThe Chinese Communist party is organized as a hierarchy, with power concentrated at the   top. Above the local units, or cells, is a pyramid-like structure of party congresses and   committees at various levels, culminating in the National Party Congress. The national   congress is supposed to meet every five years, though this has not always been the case.   When it is not in session, direction of the party is in the hands of a Central Committee   of about 200 members, which is elected by the congress. The Central Committee, in turn,   elects the Political Bureau, which in 1982 consisted of 25 full members and three   alternates. It is within the Political Bureau and its elite Standing Committee that power   is concentrated and the highest level decisions of state are made. There is also a   secretariat that carries on the day-to-day business of the party.\nPrior to 1982, the highest party office was that of chairman, held for more than 25   years, through most of the People's Republic's history to that time, by Mao Zedong. In an   effort to ensure that the power Mao had enjoyed was never again concentrated in one   person, a new party constitution adopted in 1982 abolished the chairmanship and replaced   it with the administrative position of general secretary to the Secretariat. The   constitution also established a body called the Central Advisory Commission to assist and   advise the Central Committee. One of the objects of the commission was to encourage   elderly party leaders to continue to be active in various functions of the Communist   party. The commission became an obstacle to reform and was abolished in 1992.\nTheoretically, party membership is open to anyone over 18 who accepts the party program   and is willing to work actively in one of its organizations. Members are expected to abide   by the party's discipline and to serve as model workers. The backbone of the party   consists of full-time paid workers known as cadres (Chinese, ganbu). The term cadre is   also used for public officials holding responsible positions who may or may not be members   of the party.\nTHE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nOn Oct. 1, 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of   China. The CCP hailed its takeover of China as a people's victory over and liberation from   imperial domination (especially that of the United States) and the oppressive KMT regime.   The Red Army was renamed the People's Liberation Army. During the early days of the   People's Republic, the troops were restrained, foreign-educated Chinese returned to help   the country, and most local administrators remained in office.\nThe first Communist government, the People's Consultative Council, included   non-Communists among its 662 members. However, in the top committee, 31 out of 56 seats   were occupied by Communists, and the constitution of 1954 drastically curtailed the role   of non-Communists. After 1954, more authority was concentrated in the central government   under the State Council. Real power, however, lay with the Communist party, especially the   Central Committee, then composed of 94 members. This committee held together the triad of   power--army, government, and party. The inner circle of the Central Committee was the   19-member Political Bureau and its seven-member Standing Committee.\nLand reform. One of the first tasks of the Communist government was land reform,   redistributing land from landlords to the peasants. The Agrarian Law of 1950 began the   nationwide land reform, which was almost completed by the beginning of 1953.\nSocial reform. Land reform erased the social distinction between landlord and   peasant. The new marriage law of 1950 and the campaigns of the early 1950s removed   distinctions within the family. Women were given full equality with men in matters of   marriage, divorce, and property ownership. Children were encouraged to denounce parents if   they failed to support the Communist line.\nThought reform. Believing that the revolution could not be carried on without   reform of people, the CCP launched a massive campaign to change China's entire psychology.   The Four Olds campaign was launched to eradicate old ideas, habits, customs, and culture.   The Three Anti's movement was directed at officials, with the aim of eliminating   corruption, waste, and \"bureaucratism.\" The Five Anti's campaign, directed at   the remaining businessmen and bourgeoisie, opposed bribery, tax fraud, cheating, and   stealing state property and economic information. For Chinese Christians, The Three Selfs   movement stressed self-government, self-support, and self-propagation, the object being to   separate the churches in China from their parent denominations abroad. Leading churchmen   were forced into denouncing religion as cultural imperialism. The idea of cultural   imperialism was extended to art and literature, which henceforth were to serve the people,   the class struggle, and the revolution.\nEconomic planning. Along with the reforms of land tenure, society, family, and   even thought, the CCP announced the first five-year plan in 1953 to speed up the   socialization of China through a planned economy. The plan's aim was to produce maximum   returns from agriculture in order to pay for industrialization and Soviet aid. The means   chosen was the collectivization of agriculture. Land and farm implements were pooled into   cooperatives and later into collective farms, which controlled the production, price, and   distribution of products. By May 1956, 90 percent of the farmers were members of   cooperatives.\nSimilarly, 80 percent of heavy industry and 40 percent of light industry were in   government hands by October 1952. The government also controlled all the railways and most   steamship operations. To speed China's development even more, Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, and   others, after overcoming some opposition within the leadership, launched the Great Leap   Forward in 1958.\nThe Great Leap Forward\nThe Great Leap Forward was designed to overcome the backwardness of China's economy,   industry, and technology. It was to be achieved through use of the vast manpower and   indomitable spirit of the Chinese. Steel production was to be increased by setting up   small-scale \"backyard furnaces,\" and agricultural output was to be raised by   combining the collective farms into communes. About 26,000 communes were created by the   Communist government, each composed of approximately 5,000 households.\nAfter a year, the leaders admitted that the success of the program had been   exaggerated. The steel produced by the backyard furnaces was of low quality, and the   quantity fell short of the projected goal. The people's reluctance to join communes was   stronger than expected, and the size of the communes had to be reduced. Domestic life in   homes, as well as private plots for family use, had to be restored. The effect of the   Great Leap Forward on the people and the economy was devastating. Coupled with three   straight years of poor harvests, it resulted in a severe food shortage and industrial   decline. For the next several years, while lip service was paid to Mao's thought and to   Great Leap-type activism, the real power was in more conservative hands.\nThe Cultural Revolution\nThe Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was a radical movement that closed schools,   slowed production, and virtually severed China's relations with the outside world. It was   proletarian because it was a revolution of the workers against party officials. It was   cultural because it meant to alter the values of society in the Communist sense. It was   great, because it was on a mammoth scale. It lasted for two years in its intense form,   lingered on for another year and a half, and was not officially declared over until 1977.\nThe Cultural Revolution had its roots in a power struggle between Mao and his   supporters, including his wife, Jiang Qing, and Lin Biao--who believed that the initial   fervor of the revolution was being lost--and more conservative, bureaucratic elements   within the leadership. One point at issue was the educational system, and particularly the   fact that urban youth (especially the children of privileged officials) appeared to have a   better chance of getting a university education than the children of rural peasants. Mao   feared that Chinese society was becoming rigid, and to prevent this he relied for support   on the military and on youth.\nIn the summer of 1966, a group of Beijing high school girls protested against the   system of college entrance examinations. The Central Committee acceded to the students'   demand by promising a reform and postponing the 1966 enrollment for half a year. Freed   from their studies, students demonstrated in Beijing in August, touching off   demonstrations of young people in general. Obviously inspired by Mao, youths wearing red   armbands and flashing copies of the \"little red book\" containing Mao's thought   (`Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong'), marched through the streets shouting the slogan, \"To bypass the Communist party apparatus and force the hierarchy's political foes   into submission.\" These Red Guards, as they were called, were given free railway   passes, and they poured into Beijing and other cities in great numbers throughout 1967.\nIn early 1967 some of the highest ranking leaders, former close revolutionary   associates of Mao himself, were criticized and dismissed. Liu Shaoqi, who had been   president of the republic, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping were among the better known victims.   Even Confucius was attacked as having been a hypocritical supporter of the bourgeoisie.   Throughout the country, revolutionary committees sprang up, seized power from the local   government and party authorities, and harassed--and in some cases attacked--those   suspected of being disloyal to Mao's thought.\nThe disorders reached a climax in July 1967 in the city of Wuhan, when the local   military commander tried to rally the people against the radicals and troops had to be   sent in to restore order. From that time on, steps were taken to quiet the more disruptive   portions of the Cultural Revolution, though it was not until 1968 that society returned to   something resembling normality. In March 1969 the government issued a directive to open   all schools. The situation was so chaotic, however, that the universities were not   reopened until September 1970.\nThe Cultural Revolution greatly affected the CCP leadership. When the long-postponed   ninth congress of the CCP was finally convened in April 1969, two thirds of the old   members of the Central Committee were missing. Mao's attempt to maintain a state of   permanent revolution had been immensely costly. Years of work and progress were   sacrificed: A whole generation of youth went without education; factories and farms lay   idle. China fell even further behind the industrialized powers of the world. As the   Cultural Revolution died down, Zhou Enlai, who had been premier since the founding of the   People's Republic, quietly took control. Deng Xiaoping and other \"pragmatic\" leaders were reestablished. The party and government relaxed their control over the people   and granted certain civil rights in a new constitution adopted in 1975.\nInternational Relations of the People's Republic\nThe People's Republic has undergone several shifts in foreign policy since 1949.   Initially, it was closely tied to the Soviet Union and firmly identified as a member of   the socialist camp.\nWithin a few years, however, the Sino-Soviet relationship had begun to deteriorate, the   victim, among other factors, of differing national interests, differing interpretations of   Marxism, and Chinese resentment over heavy-handed Soviet attempts at control. By the   mid-1960s China and the Soviet Union had become openly hostile toward each other.\nChina was largely isolated from the rest of the world during the height of the Cultural   Revolution, but when the upheavals subsided it began to take a more practical foreign   policy line. Trade was opened up with a number of Western countries, China started to play   an active role in international organizations, and diplomatic relations were established   with countries willing to recognize the People's Republic--rather than the Nationalist   government on Taiwan--as the government of China. Most dramatically, contacts were begun   with the United States, leading to full diplomatic recognition on Jan. 1, 1979.\nWhile China's political system changed little by the 1990s, its economy had become the   fastest-growing in the world. Relations with the United States became unstable on two   fronts. The Chinese government refused to allow the human rights concerns to become an   issue in trade talks. Trade itself became a major issue, as exports to the United States   exceeded imports. In addition, North Korea's probable possession of nuclear weapons posed   an unsettling problem for China and the United States in the mid-1990s.\nMAO ZEDONG, or MAO TSE-TUNG (1893-1976).\nIn China Mao Zedong is remembered and revered as the greatest of revolutionaries. His   achievements as ruler, however, have been deservedly downgraded because he was among the   worst of politicians. He knew well how to make a revolution, but once in power he could   not put his love of revolution aside for the sake of governing.\nMao was born on Dec. 26, 1893, in Shaoshan, Hunan Province. His father was a peasant   who had become successful as a grain dealer. Mao's schooling was intermittent. During the   Revolution of 1911-12 he served in the army for six months. After that he drifted for a   while without goals, but he managed to graduate from the First Provincial Normal School in   Changsha in 1918. He then sent to Peking University, where he became embroiled in the   revolutionary May Fourth Movement. This movement marked the decisive turn in Chinese   revolutionary thought in favor of Marxist Communism as a solution to China's problems.\nIn 1921 Mao helped found the Chinese Communist party. He was at that time a school   principal in Hunan. Two years later, when the Communists forged an alliance with Sun   Yat-sen's Nationalist party (the Kuomintang), he left work to become a full-time   revolutionary. It was at this time that Mao discovered the great potential of the peasant   class for making revolution. This realization led him to the brilliant strategy he used to   win control of China: gain control of the countryside and encircle the cities.\nThe Communists and the Nationalists coexisted in an uneasy relationship until the end   of World War II. The Nationalist leader after 1925 was Chiang Kai-shek, who was determined   to rule China. He never trusted the Communists, and at times he persecuted them. Mao's   first wife was executed by the Nationalists in 1930.\nThe Chinese Soviet Republic was founded in November 1931 in Jiangxi Province. In 1934   Mao and his forces were driven out, and they went northward in what is known as the Long   March. By 1935, however, the Communists and Nationalists forged a united front against the   Japanese. Rivalry persisted, but the front held until 1945. The revolution that then began   ended in 1949 with the Communists victorious.\nIn addition to his problems with the Nationalists, Mao's dealings with the Soviet   Union's Joseph Stalin were always uneasy. Stalin grew wary of a competing Communist power   of China's size on the Soviet borders. Mao eventually came to regard the Soviets as   revisionists and felt they were traitors to the cause of world revolution.\nMao's title as ruler of China was chairman of the People's Republic. For the first five   years he rarely appeared in public and seemed to be only a ceremonial figure. He never   achieved the total control in China that Stalin did in the Soviet Union. Many of his   comrades were influential in directing policy, often in ways with which Mao disagreed. In   1955 he emerged from isolation determined to play the decisive role in economic policy and   political restructuring.\nFailing to gain the allegiance of the intellectuals, he turned to the masses with a   program called the Great Leap Forward. While not a complete economic disaster, it had   severe consequences. After it disrupted both city and countryside, he was forced to   retreat from his policies in favor of his opponents. To counter opposition he launched the   Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, urged on by his radical wife, Jiang Qing. This vast   upheaval wrecked the Communist party bureaucracy, paralyzed education and research, and   left the economy almost a shambles.\nOnly slowly did China begin to recover. By then Mao was old and ill. Other, more   moderate hands guided policy. Zhou Enlai seemed to emerge as the nation's real leader when   relations were reestablished with the United States.\nMao's personality cult remained strong until his death on Sept. 9, 1976. Shortly   afterward, however, a power struggle was under way. Members of the party who had been   purged by the Cultural Revolution returned to govern China. Chief among them was Deng   Xiaoping (See Deng Xiaoping).\n16 POST-MAO CHINA\nPassing of the old guard.\nThe year 1976 marked the end of an era. Zhou Enlai died in January. Zhu De, who as   chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress had been serving as   nominal head of state, died in July. Finally, Mao himself, the chairman of the party and   the embodiment of the revolution, died in September. Although many elderly leaders   remained in positions of power, the old guard--the veterans of the Long March and the   civil war--was clearly passing from the scene.\nThere were no provisions for automatic succession. At one time, Lin Biao had been Mao's   designated successor, but Lin had died under mysterious circumstances in 1971. The stage   was set for a power struggle, with the initial advantage going to the radical faction.   Zhou's death left the moderate pragmatists in a weakened position, and Deng Xiaoping, as   their most visible leader, came under immediate attack.\nIn April the people staged an unusual demonstration to protest the removal, by the   police, of memorial wreaths honoring Zhou from Beijing's Tiananmen (the Gate of Heavenly   Peace leading to the old Forbidden City). With this as an excuse, the radicals blamed Deng   for the disorders and dismissed him from office. But the radicals, in turn, lost their   protector when Mao died. Within a month, the \"Gang of Four\" radical leaders,   including Jiang Qing, Mao's widow, were arrested, and Deng was reinstated once again. The   Gang of Four were subsequently tried and convicted of various crimes against the state.   They became a convenient scapegoat for the new leadership, which did not wish to blame   China's ills on Mao directly.\nIn the following years, the pragmatists consolidated their position. Although he did   not take any of the main party or government positions, Deng emerged as the outstanding   figure within the leadership. An elderly man himself, he brought in younger men who shared   his views. The new policies were confirmed in the party and state constitutions adopted in   1982. These included accelerating China's economic development by the best possible means;   for example, by rewarding good work, even if this resulted in some inequalities in   society. Steps were also taken to prevent the concentration of power that had marked Mao's   time. Thus, the new state constitution limited state leaders to two consecutive terms.\nNevertheless, the new leadership remained firmly committed to Communism. The 1982   constitution stated again the Four Fundamental Principles that should guide the society:   the leadership of the Communist party, the \"people's democratic dictatorship,\" the socialist road, and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. The new constitution allowed   a greater measure of political freedom and civil rights, and legal safeguards were   introduced. It was evident, however, that there were limits to the new liberalization.   After an early period during which considerable freedom of speech was allowed, the   post-Mao leadership began to warn against destructive criticism.\nThe Four Modernizations.\nThe new regime's goal was the development of China's economy by means of the Four   Modernizations: of agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology.   The Four Modernizations were first announced by Zhou at the tenth party congress in 1973,   when the country was just starting its slow recovery from the Cultural Revolution. The new   leadership under Deng placed great stress on them, with the aim of bringing China into the front rank among the world's nations.\nTo achieve the ambitious aims of the program, the new leadership replaced the Maoist   dogma of stressing the revolutionary spirit, the \"red,\" with the practical value   of the \"expert.\" In education, academic achievements were emphasized, and   nationwide college entrance examinations were reinstated. In industry, the authority of   experts was reasserted. In agriculture, peasants were allowed private plots. Some   overambitious projects were begun, and some replanning proved necessary. Nevertheless, the   Chinese were cautiously optimistic that they would attain their goals. They set a   reasonable economic growth rate of 7.2 percent per year and began a rigorous campaign to   slow the rate of population increase. They hoped that these measures would quadruple   industrial and agricultural production by the year 2000. In 1987 Deng retired and was   succeeded by Zhao Ziyang as general secretary and Li Peng as premier. (See Deng Xiaoping;   Zhao Ziyang)\nDENG XIAOPING (born 1904).\nDuring the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, China's Communist government publicly   humiliated Deng Xiaoping by parading him through the national capital in a dunce cap. Yet,   after the deaths of Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong in 1976, he emerged as his country's   paramount leader. Whether in exile or in power, Deng was long acclaimed as a reformer who   resisted rigid Communist ideology. But his image was tarnished in mid-1989 when he ordered   a military crackdown on the student pro-democracy movement. At the same time the   government began to build a personality cult around the aging, ailing survivor of purges   who had once belittled the similar deification of Mao. Deng Xiaoping was born on Aug. 22,   1904, to a wealthy family in Sichuan Province. At age 16 he went to Paris to study. While   there he was befriended by Zhou. After he returned home in 1924, Deng joined the Communist   party and was sent to the Soviet Union for another year of study. In the political   movement led by Mao, he started out as an underground organizer. He participated in the   Long March of 1934-35.\nDeng became a vice-premier in 1952, the party secretary in 1954, and a member of the   ruling Politburo in 1955. During the Cultural Revolution radical Maoists condemned him as   a bourgeois \"freak.\" In 1973 he was rehabilitated under Zhou, and, as the most   senior vice-premier, became the effective head of the government during Zhou's later   illness. But Mao's supporters were alarmed by his efforts to promote economic reform   through \"capitalist methods of production.\" Instead of succeeding Zhou when the   premier died, Deng was banished by the radical Gang of Four, an elite group of Mao's   supporters led by Mao's wife, Jiang Qing.\nAfter Mao's death, the Gang of Four lost power. Until 1980-81 Deng struggled for   supreme control with Hua Guofeng, Mao's chosen successor, but he finally engineered the   promotions of his own proteges--Zhao Ziyang as premier and Hu Yaobang as party secretary.   In late 1987, to force the resignation of senior leaders, Deng gave up his own committee   posts. At the beginning of the year Hu Yaobang had been ousted because his leniency toward   dissidents and his support of Western-style democracy were blamed for a rash of student   demonstrations for reform. In Deng's next effort to establish the line of succession, Zhao   took over the party leadership.\nFor the rebellious Chinese students, Hu's disgrace had made him a martyr; his death on   April 15, 1989, became the catalyst for more aggressive pro-democracy demonstrations that   ended in the massacre of unarmed marchers in Peking (Beijing) on June 4. Deng's other   designated heir, Zhao, was removed because he favored concessions to the protesters. A new   leader, Jiang Zemin, was chosen for his law-and-order stance during similar demonstrations   in Shanghai. General Secretary Jiang next took over Deng's chairmanship of the party's   Central Military Commission in November 1989. Deng resigned from his last official post in   March 1990. (See China)\nJiang Zemin (born 1926).\nIn the wake of the student-led pro-democracy movement in China, Jiang Zemin emerged as   one of the nation's most influential Communist leaders. In June 1989, when the Communist   party was purged of its moderate leaders, he was appointed party general secretary and   chosen as the heir apparent to the senior leader Deng Xiaoping (See Deng Xiaoping).\nJiang was born in July 1926 in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province. Little is known about his   childhood. He joined the Communist party while attending Shanghai's Jiaotong University,   where he graduated in 1947 with a degree in electrical engineering. After several Shanghai   factory jobs and advanced training in Moscow in the 1950s, Jiang worked up to a top   position at a northeastern Chinese automobile plant. He did not hold a government post   until 1980. Jiang became a member of the party's Central Committee in 1982 and the   Political Bureau in 1987. As the mayor of Shanghai from 1985 until his surprise   appointment as general secretary, and later the city's party chief, Jiang had gained   recognition as an economic reformer. Many believed the ideologically tough Jiang was   chosen to replace the moderate Zhao Ziyang as a reward for his swift action in quelling   the student demonstrations in Shanghai. (See Zhao Ziyang)\nAs general secretary, Jiang called for strict vigilance against what he described as   efforts by the West to subvert the Chinese government. In October 1989 the party announced   that Jiang would serve as the \"core\" of the next generation of Chinese leaders."

It follows symbologist Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu as they investigate a murder in Paris’s Louvre Museum and discover a battle between the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei over the possibility of Jesus Christ of Nazareth having been married to Mary Magdalene. The title of the novel refers to, among other things, the fact that the murder victim is found in the Denon Wing of the Louvre, naked and posed like Leonardo da Vinci’s famous drawing, the Vitruvian Man, with a cryptic message written beside his body and a pentacle drawn on his stomach in his own blood.\nThe novel has provoked a popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail legend and Magdalene’s role in the history of Christianity. The book has been extensively denounced by many Christian denominations as an attack on the Roman Catholic Church. It has also been criticized for its historical and scientific inaccuracy.\nPublished : 1951\nOriginal Language : English\nOriginally published for adults, it has since become popular with adolescent readers for its themes of teenage confusion, angst, sexuality, alienation, and rebellion. The novel’s protagonist and antihero, Holden Caulfield, has become an icon for teenage rebellion.\nThe novel was included on a 2005 Time Magazine list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the United States for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and teenage angst. It also deals with complex issues of identity, belonging, connection, and alienation.\nPublished : 1988\nOriginal Language : Portuguese\nThe Alchemist (Portuguese: O Alquimista) is an allegorical novel by Paulo Coelho first published in 1988. It follows Santiago, a young shepherd who lives in Spain, on a journey to fulfill his Personal Legend and find his Treasure at the Pyramids in Egypt. It has been hailed as a modern classic. The plot is inspired by Jorge Luis Borges’ short story: Tale of two dreamers. The Alchemist was originally written in Portuguese and has since been translated into 67 languages, winning the Guinness World Record for most translated book by a living author.\nOf course not surprising to see most of the books mentioned in the list are spiritual books. But there are some titles on the list is quite a bit surprising. Apparently the books on Mao Tze Dong has a fantastic sales figures. Apart from spiritual books, best-selling books seems dominated by the novel. The only non-novel that entered the list is Xin Hua Zi Dian (Xinhua Dictionary) (# 5). But the best-selling books seem still dominated by old novels. The only new novel that can penetrate the ranks of top 20 sales is The Da Vinci Code which is has a little religious element.\nMotivational books written by great guru like Anthony Robbins, Stephen Covey, Dale Carnegie, Robert T Kiyosaki was just reaching for sale below 50 million copies. The highest sales figures for motivation books  is Think and Grow Rich (Napoleon Hill) which can reach 30 million of sales, followed by 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (Stephen Covey) which can reach 15 million of sales, and # 3 is How to Win Friends and Influence People (Dale Carnigie) which also can reach 15 million of sales. Some phenomenal book usually covered on the media recently is not even in the top 20 best selling all the time. For example: The most best-selling Harry Potter which is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (the final series) only achieve sales figures about 44 million copies, Meanwhile Twilight (first book) as the best selling Twilight series was only achieved 17 million copies sales. Technical books would be very difficult to penetrate this list. Maybe only Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book (#36) that on the list.\nMeanwhile, in terms of language, books that fall into this best-seller list was still dominated by the original language of the book is the language now recognized as an international language which are English & China.\nHere are the rest of list Top 50 Best Selling Books of All The Time (21-50) :\n21. Steps to Christ (Ellen G. White – 1892), Sold : 60 million\n28. The Hite Report (Shere Hite – 1976), Sold : 48 million\n29. Charlotte’s Web (E.B.

(Santa Monica and Venice are the beach communities that are closest to central Los Angeles).\nMALIBU\nMalibu is the \"brand name\" beach community of LA County, world-famous for:\n1. Gidget and Elvis beach movies of the 50's and 60's as well as home to the fictitious address in the popular, current TV series “Two and a Half Men”\n2. As a surfing destination\n3. As a location of celebrity beach homes\n4. As the name of a Chevy car\n5. And, as a word found on T-shirts sold around the world.\nMalibu has a single bus line along Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) which connects to Santa Monica and to a bus transfer center in mid-Los Angeles at Fairfax Ave. & Washington Blvd. The bus to Malibu runs less frequently than most of the buses to Santa Monica or Venice. Malibu is a very elongated community with beaches, stores, and restaurants strung out along the road. Thus the bus to Malibu works acceptably for going to a single beach, but not so well for going to more than one part of the community.\nIt is north (and west) of Santa Monica, beyond the sleepy, narrow beaches of Pacific Palisades, and is on the outer edge of the major urban area of LA.\nIf you are imagining a gorgeous French-Riviera-like Eden with celebs visible everywhere, or by contrast, a tranquil seaside retreat, you may be in for a disappointment on both counts. Most of Malibu's coastline is a narrow stretch of beach (some of it, private, with no public access and, in many cases, not visible to the public), running parallel to the multi-lane, high-traffic Pacific Coast Highway, affectionately referred to as the PCH, a 4 lane highway through the area. Because it is only major east/west road in the city, it can be very crowded during certain times of the day. The beaches are beautiful, windswept, boulder strewn, and natural.  On the inland side of PCH (away from the beach) are the Santa Monica mountains, where there are many hiking trails of all levels, some residential neighborhoods, cliffs, canyons and mountain views of the Pacific Ocean.  \nAs you head west, the cliffs soften to hills (also covered in houses) and you approach Malibu Canyon Road, with Pepperdine University visible above. This area is the town center of Malibu, on Cross Creek Road, in a few tiny shopping centers on the inland side of the PCH. If you are of the star-struck persuasion, this is a good place to park, walk, grab a latte, and look for those stars and celebs. You're as likely to be lucky here as anywhere, as many stars do have homes in Malibu, and these are the local places to shop and eat. The homes get bigger, with gated estates, as you go west in Malibu. For the most part, you still can't see the beach-- though now at least you can imagine Barbra Streisand, etc, behind those lavish gates.\nHeading much farther west in Malibu, views of the ocean increase, and there are some great beaches with excellent public access, at Zuma and Leo Carillo. It's a good long drive to get there though-- Malibu goes on for 28 miles.\nThere are few hotels/motels in Malibu. Malibu has little in the way of tourist infrastructure; there are vast stretches of PCH with no restaurants nor shops. Malibu as a day trip using a car from Santa Monica and Los Angeles is excellent, bring a picnic to enjoy at one of the state parks (Leo Carillo or Pt. Mugu are remote and beautiful).  \n Before you arrive in Santa Monica, you might note The Getty Villa sign.  The villa is a beautiful venue to see some of the Getty treasures, but a reservation is required, so refer to their website for details. \n \nSANTA MONICA\nSanta Monica is one of LA's most famous beach communities. It is a separate city of more than 80,000 on the far northwestern edge of Los Angeles. During summer weekends, the population can swell to one million people enjoying the seaside city.  Santa Monica is an upscale city with a vibrant, urban character, and is the home of some of the most sophisticated restaurants, hotels and shopping in the LA area. There's always something to see or do in Santa Monica, but you'll be disappointed here if you were looking for a secluded seaside retreat. Santa Monica has some of the area's most deluxe oceanfront hotels, but like almost all hotels in Santa Monica, they're not cheap. As with most cities these days, there are homeless individuals in the downtown area.  The core of the beach area here is a wide stretch of sand surrounding a pleasure pier with an historic, turn-of-the-century carousel, a small amusement park, arcade, small aquarium beneath the pier, and some restaurants, mostly seafood.  The pier is fun, busy, with a diverse crowd.\nA new addition to the downtown Santa Monica area is Tongva Park and the refurbished City Hall gardens and fountains.  A fine place to stroll, excellent Pacific Ocean views, this park has a nice area for children that includes a fine water feature, so have the kids wear bathing suits.  \nThere's a bike path that runs along the edge of the beach, beginning at Will Rogers State Beach to Torrance, 22 miles long.  The name is the Marvin Braude Bike Path for those who wish to research further online.  Bike rentals are available at many places along the beach and renting a bike here is a great way to spend the day and see many of the beach communities. Santa Monica beach has many visitor amenities including the Annenberg Beach House - a public beach house with a pool, the original muscle beach near the pier, the original Hot Dog on a Stick, chair rentals, cafes with decent food and smoothies in nice seating areas with umbrellas.  Restroom facilities are constantly being upgraded.  Playgrounds dot all the beaches.  Surfing lessons and yoga classes can be found at some places along the beach.  Venice is just to the south of Santa Monica; parking in the South Santa Monica beach parking lots makes for an easy walk to Venice Beach.  \nSanta Monica is pedestrian friendly. There are several gathering places of note.  Main Street has unique shops, some chain stores, and many bars and restaurants.  There is a festive farmers market at Ocean Park and Main each Sunday morning with good prepared foods. Montana Avenue is upscale with shops and restaurants.  One is more apt to spot a celebrity getting coffee or running errands here than anywhere else in town.  3rd Street Promenade and the Santa Monica mall in the downtown core have many shops of all price points on a festive street where no cars can drive.  Although it isn't \"central\" for visiting LA, it is as central as any beach area gets. And it is very close to both Getty Museums (the Villa and the Center). If you have a car for visiting the rest of LA, it is a great place to stay.\nSanta Monica has good regional transit access and is served by multiple bus lines, including a bus from LAX and an express bus from Downtown Los Angeles.  The city's bus line is called the Big Blue Bus.  There are HOHO buses that start from Santa Monica, run by Starline Tours.  Being 7 miles from LAX means taxi fare is reasonable.  Light Rail will be completed by 2016, which will connect Santa Monica with downtown LA.\n \nVENICE\nVenice is the beach just to the south of Santa Monica, famous as funky beach area on Oceanfront Walk full of, ah, \" characters\" and stalls of knock-off sunglasses, T-shirt, henna tattoos and other sundry items. The  beach is bordered on by a 2 mile (3.2 km) walkway that serves pedestrians, bicyclists and skaters and skate boarders.  The walk from central Santa Monica to central Venice takes about 40 minutes.\nThe two beaches blend together; there is no special spot that separates the two. Off the beach, Venice has a distinct edgy character, and unlike some areas marketed as \"artists' colonies\" , Venice, doesn't really advertise this fact, but has long been home to many world-famous contemporary artists who open their studios to tours once a year. Abbot Kinney Blvd. has some of LA's trendiest restaurants.  The Venice canals are lovely to stroll, hand in hand.  Venice is an interesting place to visit, and has a very distinct personality, but is not the best base for a family vacation.\nVenice has a number of regional bus lines serving it, including buses to Santa Monica and Westwood, Downtown LA and Culver City.\nMARINA DEL REY\nMarina del Rey has a relatively unknown beach called \"Mother's Beach\" aka Basin D. It's at the corner of Admiralty Way and Via Marina. The beach is a cove with two hotels (Foghorn Harbor Inn & the Jamaica Bay Inn) and 2 restaurants (the Cheesecake Factory & The Vu). The cove is off the inland waterway so there is little to no wave movement, here. The swimming area constitutes about 1/2 of the cove. The other half of the cove is enjoyed by windsurfers (sailboarders). Just beyond the swimming area is the start of the Marina so there will be hundreds of boats visible from the cove. Guests from the two adjacent hotels have balconies overlooking the beach and the restaurants have outdoor patio dining. There is a parking area at the corner of Admiralty Way & Via Marina for visitors to the cove. It's a 1/2 mile .8 km) walk from Basin D to the ocean beach at Venice. Simply walk one block north on Via Marina to Washington Blvd, turn left and walk to the end of the road. There is also a number of dining options (in all price ranges) along the way.  For visitors with a rental car who are looking for more budget accommodations near the beach, Marina del Rey is a fair option.\n \nPLAYA DEL REY\nImmediately south of Marina del Rey is the isolated little beach village of Playa del Rey. Quiet, serene, with wide, white sand beaches, the little residential community is reminiscent of mid-century beach towns. A scattering of local dives, some pretty good restaurants, and a quiet beach front gives the area its slow paced flavor. It is surrounded by the newly restored Ballona Wetlands, which are a treasure of coastal wildlife on the Westside.\nSOUTH BAY AND LONG BEACH\nThe South Bay is generally recognized as beginning at Los Angeles International Airport, and moving south from there, including the south beach towns of Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach, Palos Verdes and Long Beach. Right out of a postcard of Southern California, they offer sand that stretches out of sight, clean water, beach volleyball, and beachfront paths for rollerblading, cycling and walking.\nManhattan Beach: Manhattan Beach is an affluent, independent city just south of LAX airport. The Downtown area of MB is a mix of trendy restaurants, family friendly dining, shops and is topped off by the MB Pier where you can watch volleyball and the surfers. There are mid-range luxury hotels and more budget friendly hotels on Pacific Coast Highway (also called Highway 1 & Sepulveda Blvd) near the two shopping centers, Manhattan Village and Manhattan Gateway. It is a quieter alternative from Santa Monica for families and couples, but on a smaller scale and not as easily walkable.\nHermosa Beach: Hermosa Beach is the beach community due south of and adjacent to Manhattan Beach. It can be hard to tell where one stops and the next starts. A beachfront sidewalk connects the cities and you can walk or rollerblade from the MB Pier to the HB Pier. Downtown HB is an eclectic mix of restaurants and bars and some shops, but hotels are limited in HB.\nRedondo Beach: Redondo Beach is the next city down and features the King’s Harbor small craft harbor with a variety of restaurants, hotels and shops. One of Redondo’s biggest charms is also one of its biggest drawbacks, it doesn’t have easy, direct access to freeways, you have to drive 15-20 minutes for the nearest freeway. On the plus side, it is close to the giant Del Amo Fashion Center, one of California’s largest shopping malls.\nLong Beach: Long Beach is an independent city -- not part of the city of Los Angeles. It features the Queen Mary, the Carnival Cruise Lines docks, an aquarium, a city beach and an airport (where discount flights like Jet Blue arrive). All of the beaches in and near the Downtown Long Beach area are inside the breakwater of the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. The best beach in Long Beach is the Belmont Shore at the extreme, south end of Long Beach. There are no hotels close by, but there are vacation rentals and a lively area of shops and restaurants.\nSan Pedro/Wilmington: The official Port of Los Angeles where the commercial freight arrives for this region of the country. It is also the port for all pleasure cruises, except Carnival Cruise Lines, and whale-watching cruises. Cabrillo Marine Museum is here. There is a water-side shopping center of shops and restaurants.\nORANGE COUNTY BEACHES\nFurther south are the beach communities of Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach and others, for information on them, click here Orange County Beaches .\nShare your knowledge"

The water at Laguna is generally clean and calm, though occasionally the Pacific tends to be cool with strong tides. Clean, white and warm, Laguna's sands are perfect for strolling, volleyball matches or simply unwinding on a blanket.\nCoronado\niStock\nFor well over a century, Coronado's beaches have been its fortune, namely the seaside in front of the glamorous Hotel Del Coronado open since 1888. For non-hotel guests, the main beach, Coronado Central Beach, stretches 1.5 miles behind the great houses along Ocean Boulevard. Swimmers, bodysurfers, boogie boarders, sand sculptors, tide poolers and, from December through February, whale watchers all take to the sand and sea. North Beach attracts surfers in the morning, and at the extreme north is Dog Beach, where leashless canines can frolic in the surf.\nVideo: The Del on Coronado Beach\nMarianela takes a tour of Hotel del Coronado -- prime beachfront property.\nThe Del on Coronado Beach\n \nMarianela takes a tour of Hotel del Coronado -- prime beachfront property.\nEl Matador Beach\niStock\nIf you've come to El Matador to savor the beach rather than get sucked into the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles, then you're in luck -- there's blissfully little else to do here other than bask on Malibu's most glorious stretch of beach. The best way to enjoy your time is to check the tide schedule, pack a picnic lunch or sunset dinner, grab a blanket, and trek down to one of El Matador's hidden nooks and coves to enjoy the incredibly romantic atmosphere.\nVenice Beach\niStock\nNo beach in the world is like Venice Beach. Sure, other California beaches have sand, surf and sunshine. But they do not have a 3-ring urban street circus, complete with philosophizing artists, trash-talking hoopsters, preening weightlifters, barefoot sand sculptors and more. All of this frenetic activity happens on Ocean Front Walk, a 3/4-mile concrete boardwalk with stores, fast-food spots, flea markets and artists.\nVideo: Venice Beach's Weirdness\nMarianela soaks in the weirdness and visits her favorite spot on Venice Beach.\nVenice Beach's Weirdness\nMarianela soaks in the weirdness and visits her favorite spot on Venice Beach.\nSanta Monica\nThinkStock\nThere’s never a shortage of seaside fun at Santa Monica Pier where the beach meets the boardwalk in a festive display of amusement park rides, aquarium wonders and festival food. It’s free to stroll the historic boardwalk and peruse the goods, and even if you don’t go for thrill rides, there’s no charge for the show-stopping sunset at the end of each day.\nNewport Beach\niStock\nTrendsetters, jet-setters, and beach lovers in the know have been taking advantage of Newport Beach's coastal charms for decades. There's the ritzy harbor most folks will only dream of docking a yacht in; beachside \"bungalows\" worth many, many millions; a shopping district so chic, Rodeo Drive looks discounted; and, oh yes, an utterly magnificent stretch of beach. This wide bed of sand, silky and blonde, rolls south from Newport Pier to Balboa Pier, and plays host to diehard surfers, serious sunbathers, trendy 20-somethings and families. Sitting by a weathered pier, gazing past wooden lifeguard stands toward a fiery sunset, one can't help but wax nostalgic for days when Beach Boys records and long boards were all the rage.\nHermosa Beach\niStock\nHermosa Beach takes pride in its abundance of outdoor beach activities, which include surfing, swimming, paddleball, sunbathing and, of course, volleyball -- there always seems to be intense serving and spiking action on the 1.5-mile stretch of sand. By day, the Strand, a paved boardwalk that borders the beach, is a thoroughfare for bikers, bladers, joggers and strollers. At night, the Strand is a great people-watching spot as crowds fill the restaurants and bars.\nLa Jolla Cove\nThinkStock\nWith its small crescent of sand tucked between towering sandstone cliffs, La Jolla Cove is one of the smallest but also the most photographed beaches along the Southern California coastline. And things are just as lovely below the surface at this is popular spot for scuba-diving and snorkeling, thanks to visibility that extends up to 30 feet and wildlife protected by the San Diego La Jolla Underwater Park Ecological Reserve.\nCatalina Island\nThinkStock\nLocated 22 miles off the Southern California coast, Catalina Island is known for its myriad of outdoor activities like snorkeling, scuba, horseback-riding, kayaking and hiking. After an active day, stroll around the quaint social center of the island at Avalon for window-shopping, gallery-hopping and a gourmet meal. Bring a camera as photo opportunities present themselves at almost every turn; shutterbugs should be on the lookout for grazing buffalo. Boats depart from Newport Beach, Long Beach, San Pedro and Dana Point; for jet-setters who don't want to waste any time traveling, helicopter trips are also a possibility.\nCrystal Cove State Park\nThinkStock\nA secluded beach stretching some 3.5 miles, an official \"underwater park\" teeming with reefs and 2,000-plus wooded acres for exploring make Crystal Cove State Park a remarkable escape from the crowds and bustle of Newport Harbor. Tide pools and coves delight visitors to the beach year-round, though rangers advise exploration of these during winter, when lower tides present clearer views of the aquatic life. Carved into the park's ridges and canyons are more than 23 miles of mountain-biking, horseback-riding and hiking trails, many of which feature steep, rocky climbs.\nThe Hot List"

    "content": "LA's Best Family Friendly Beaches - Los Angeles.com\nShare\nLA is know for fantastic beaches, but not all beaches are created equal, especially when it comes to family friendly beaches.\nHowever, there are several well-groomed beaches frequented by families, featuring clean water, lifeguards and safe swimming conditions, bathroom facilities and family-friendly attractions nearby.\nHere are some of the best options LA has to offer:\nAnnenberg Beach House\nThis relic of newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst was formerly a sprawling 100-room estate. Much of it has since been torn down, however the heart of the original building still remains and apart from boasting a fantastic piece of California’s golden history (complete with exhibits that both parents and kids can enjoy), the Beach House features a splash pad perfect for toddlers, a public pool and play area. What’s more, the Beach House is just a walk across the parking lot to the actual beach, so visitors can get the best of both worlds.\nZuma Beach\n30000 Pacific Coast Hwy, Malibu\nZuma has the cleanest water of nearly any beach in the Los Angeles area, as it sits at a point far away from any storm drainage. Zuma also offers much better swimming conditions for youngsters than some of Malibu’s more Westward beaches such as Point Dune. This is because Zuma has a longer sand shelf, which makes for waves that are usually more gentle than other beaches in the area. It offers multiple lifeguard locations and bathroom facilities and there’s even an LA County Sherri’s Office branch at the beach. Neptune’s Net , a classic California coastal fish stand just up the road on PCH, is a great option for a snack on the way home.\nRedondo State Beach\nTorrance Blvd and Esplanade Ave, Redondo Beach\nRedondo is the best beach to take kids in all of the South Bay. It is removed from the party atmosphere of Manhattan and Hermosa beaches, offering a much more quiet scene away from the riff raff of the crowded bars. Families can walk along the Redondo Beach Pier, which is rife with kid-friendly shops and it even has an old-school arcade. There is ample parking in several structures along the beach.\nWill Rogers State Beach\nPacific Coast Hwy and Temescal Cyn Rd, Malibu\nWill Rogers offers parking very close to the sand, which is great for those who don’t want to walk across the parking lot in bare feet. The beach also has a very short and navigable hiking trail, which is a fun departure from the water and is one of the only beaches in the L.A. area that has a playground. Showers, lifeguards, and all of the usual accoutrements are available.\nMalibu Surfrider Beach\n23200 Pacific Coast Hwy, Malibu\nSurfrider might not always be calm enough for the kids to swim, but more often than not, the waves are only a foot high, or so. Parking is easy, and unlike some of the more central beaches such as Venice and Santa Monica, the water quality is pristine since Surfrider sits on a point. The beach is also huge, giving plenty of opportunity to set up a private camp where you won’t be disturbed. There are restrooms, lifeguards and volleyball courts.\nMain Beach Park\nPacific Coast Hwy and Ocean Ave, Laguna Beach\nThis is the first of a long string of beaches in the affluent community of Laguna in Orange County just south of LA, and by far the best for kids. It offers a protected barricade with rocks on its North side, so the water is calmer than much of the other beaches along the coast. There are bathrooms, showers, lifeguards on duty and a paved ocean-front walk. Bikes can be rented nearby, and there are multiple ice-cream shops and shops within a few blocks.\nFind more things to do in LA with the LosAngeles.com Attractions Guide ."

    "content": "Mad Max (1979) - FAQ\nThe content of this page was created directly by users and has not been screened or verified by IMDb staff.\nVisit our FAQ Help to learn more\nFAQ\nDid Goose and Jesse die?\nYes, Max's boss mentions that \"Goose bought it.\". The Doctors talking about Jesse are convinced that she will die because her injuries are severe. The doctor instructs the nurse to re-assure Max that Jesse will be pull through. However, Max was right outside the room and overheard them talking about the extent of her injuries and that she won't survive.\nAre there two versions of the same film?\nBasically no, but there is one version with two audio differences; the first being the original Australian accented soundtrack and the second being the American dubbed soundtrack.\nApart from dubbing the entire movie because Americans might find Australian accents difficult to understand, \"Mad Max\" in North America was completely the same cut. The original Australian dialogue soundtrack was released for the North American DVD premiere in 2000.\nWhy does the Night Rider start crying while Max pursues him?\nThe Night Rider probably experienced an acute onset of depression because he'd finally met an opponent who might catch him or matched him for driving ability. Also, he probably felt he couldn't escape. It actually adds another element of humor to the scene.\nIt is also likely that he was relying on his reckless nature as an advantage to outmaneuver the police. Along comes an officer who beats him in a game of chicken, and who is also driving a patrol car that can catch up to the one he is driving from a dead stop, and he knows that he isn't likely to get out of this alive. Max' wife mentions that he has been on the news several times, it is also possible that Nightrider recognized the notorious Max in his rearview mirror. Barring all else, Nightrider is shown to be quite psychologically unstable, screaming like a lunatic in nearly every shot in which he appears. Merely losing the game of chicken may have been enough to damage his fragile psyche to that degree.\nWhat year does this film take place in?\n\"A FEW YEARS FROM NOW...\" but a specific year is never mentioned and so the exact year is left ambiguous, with signs of society breaking down. The film was influenced by fuel shortages in Australia in the mid-1970s due to the 1973 OPEC Oil Crisis, which led to several violent incidents throughout the country.\nIs this movie based on a book?\nNo. It's an original story by director George Miller and his writing team. However, it's believed Miller did base it on riots that took place in 1970s Australia over fuel shortages and the muscle car culture that was popular back then.\nWhat are the differences between the old BBFC 18 Version and the R-Rated Version?\nThe UK theatrical version was cut in one scene . This version was used for the old VHS by Warner from 1986. All other VHS and DVD releases are uncut. Approx. 50 seconds are missing in this version and a detailed comparison between both cuts can be found here."

Movies themselves provide very little backstory and concrete information as to what exactly triggered the events leading up to the apocalypse. The first movie gives almost no exposition except for the opening line \"A few years from now\". The sequel provides a vague description of events that led to the apocalypse, not detailed enough to determine when it happened and who was responsible for it. The third movie shows a bit more of the backstory but again, it is rudimentary. The entire Mad Max trilogy does not explicitly provide any dates except for two hidden ones in Mad Max and one partially obscured in Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. The dates are as follows (in order of appearance):\nMad Max:\nDecember 6th, 1984 written on the Highway 9 Sector 26 sign\n\"est. 1983\" seen on the MFP plate at the gates of Halls Of Justice (not visible in the movie, info retrieved from a movie prop)\nMad Max: Beyond Thunderdome:\nSeptember 10th 1999:  the day  Captain Walker  left  The Crack In The Earth  along with other adults from the crashed  Boeing 747  in search of civilization. In the script, this date was originally November 8th, 2005.\nGeorge Miller revealed in an interview [1] from 1984 that the events of the first two movies took place some odd 15 years from then. This would place the first two movies in the mid to late 90's. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome takes place 15-18 years after which puts it in 2014 - 2018.\nPersian Gulf War\nThe Persian Gulf War (Pre-Mad Max)\n\"Law and order, like every other aspect of the Western society have been swept away - put to the torch one early morning when Iranian troops trying to export revolution, struck deep into the heart of Saudi Arabia\". [2]\nThe war between Iran and Saudi Arabia left the Persian Gulf devastated in just two days. The oil fields were set ablaze and oil export halted almost immediately. Prices of oil doubled, then quadrupled and quadrupled again. North West and Trans-Persian pipelines have been destroyed shortly after. The West's seven biggest oil companies led by Exxon (The 7 Sisters Petroleum - as seen on the tanker in Mad Max 2) have immediately announced they will not fulfill their supply contracts.\nImpact on Australia\nThe price of gold skyrocketed along with the inflation. In an attempt to save the economy and conserve fuel - martial laws have been announced all across the world. Italy and Spain have been taken over by the military. The Australian economy collapsed, companies filed bankruptcy one after another. Massive lay-offs caused the heavy industry to shut down. In Sydney & Melbourne panic turned into riots. People tried to withdraw savings from banks only to see the bank doors nailed shut. Gas stations were sucked dry by people fighting over last drops of gasoline. Ordinary citizens began to arm themselves. The Outback was slowly taken over by bike gangs. The remaining oil tankers were under constant attack. Vehicles that ran out of fuel were abandoned on the roads. Intercity communication stopped.\nMad Max\nMain Force Patrol (MFP)  was formed as the last-ditch attempt to uphold the law on the roads. Max Rockatansky  was one of the best drivers in the MFP. He went rogue after his friend and family were killed by a biker gang.\nFurther decay (Pre-Mad Max 2)\nCoal & fuel powered generators ground to a halt causing the lights to go out. All electrical appliances stopped working. Suddenly food became a precious commodity. Looting became common by day, preying on the weak common by night. It had become obvious that the weak would perish and the strong would survive. As a result, lone scavengers began to form gangs that roamed the Wasteland in their home-made dune buggies and bikes. [3]\nPeople were fleeing the cities. Papagallo - a former oil company employee - took maps leading to the Compound and headed there along with the others. [4] Max wandered out into the Wastelands. Lord Humungus  - a former military member whose face had been disfigured in an accident [5] formed a gang along with Wez - a Vietnam vet. His gang bolstered their forces through the recruitment of lone scavengers, some of which with a military background.\nAt this point, the MFP ceased to exist and the former officers joined gangs.  MFP vehicles were scavenged and modified by the gangs. \nMad Max 2\nThree years after the events in Mad Max the society was in complete decay, the economy was nonexistent, people had fled out into the Wastelands for safety only to find that Marauders were roaming there for fuel and resources.\nNuclear apocalypse (Post-Mad Max2)\nApocalypse\nAfter the economy collapsed and the fabric of society disintegrated all across the world, the remaining governments were still trying to secure the last oil resources. This had led to a global nuclear exchange. It is unknown who struck first, but everyone had suffered. Nuclear winter followed shortly after. The pilot Captain Walker tried to take people out to safety from Sydney onboard of a Boeing 747 . The plane had crashed due to turbulence and the remaining survivors formed a tribe. The climate changed once again, it became dry and hot, deserts started to form. \nMad Max Beyond Thunderdome\n15 years after the events of Mad Max 2, the society as we know it no longer exists. The only remaining shreds of civilization either live off of the old world or decide to start over again. Water is scarce & radioactive. The landscape had been turned into a desert. Oil is no longer.\nReferences"

This movie is an account of the road war which follows. It is based on the Word Burgers of the History Men and eyewitness accounts of those who survived.\" [1]\nContents\nSpoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow. Reader's discretion advised.\nOriginal storyboard opening shot.\n50 years after the apocalypse [2] , Australia is a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. Max ( Tom Hardy ), a former MFP officer, is captured by the War Boys , the army of a tyrannical cult leader named Immortan Joe ( Hugh Keays-Byrne ). Designated as a universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a living blood bag for a sickly War Boy called Nux ( Nicholas Hoult ). Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa ( Charlize Theron ) drives her heavily-armored War Rig to collect gasoline in nearby Gas Town . However, Furiosa begins driving off route, alerting Joe who realizes that his Five Wives ( Rosie Huntington-Whiteley , Riley Keough , Zoë Kravitz , Abbey Lee Kershaw , and Courtney Eaton ) — beautiful and healthy women specially selected for breeding — are gone. Joe leads his entire War Boy army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of his allies in Gas Town and the Bullet farm .\nNux joins the army with Max strapped to the hood of his car, to continue supplying blood. A battle ensues between the Rig and Joe's forces. Furiosa drives into an approaching sand storm to evade her pursuers. Nux, driven by Joe's indoctrinated belief that dying in battle will take him to Valhalla, attempts to destroy the Rig by making his car explode upon impact on the massive truck. Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car is destroyed by the Rig. Waking up after the storm, Max sees Furiosa nearby repairing her Rig, accompanied by the Wives who are cleaning themselves with water and removing fanged metal chastity belts from their bodies. Max engages in a fight with the women and steals the Rig, but its kill-switch disables the truck. Max reluctantly agrees to let Furiosa and the Wives accompany him, while Nux returns to Joe.\nFuriosa drives through Rock Riders territory into a narrow canyon, having previously agreed to exchange gasoline for safe passage. However, Joe's forces are close behind, and Furiosa flees while the Bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe's path. Max and Furiosa fend off the pursuing Bikers, but Joe's vehicle evades the blockade and assaults the Rig. Nux boards the Rig while Joe attempts to shoot Furiosa. Angharad — Joe's heavily pregnant wife — shields Furiosa, but falls from the Rig and is run over by Joe's car, killing her and his child and leaving the remaining Wives devastated by her death. Furiosa explains to Max that they are escaping to the \" Green Place of Many Mothers \", a location she remembers from her youth. Capable finds Nux, distraught that he contributed to the death of Joe's wife; touched by his remorse, she consoles him. At night, the heavy Rig gets caught in deep mud. Furiosa and Max slow Joe's forces with explosives, but Joe's ally, the Bullet Farmer , pursues the Rig. Nux helps free the Rig while Furiosa shoots and blinds the Bullet Farmer. He retaliates with machine gun fire and explosives. Max wanders into the dark to confront the Bullet Farmer, killing him and safely returning to the Rig with guns and ammunition.\nAs dawn breaks, the Rig travels through swampland and desert, and the group eventually encounters a naked woman. Max identifies it as a trap, but Furiosa leaves the Rig and states her former clan affiliation, revealing that she is of the Vuvalini . The woman, Valkyrie ( Megan Gale ), summons a group of desert bikers who realize that Furiosa is a member of their all-female clan; kidnapped with her mother by Immortan Joe when she was a child. Furiosa is distraught to learn that the swamp land they passed was in fact the Green Place, which is now uninhabitable. The group agree to ride their motorbikes across the immense salt flats in the hope of finding somewhere to live. Max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of Glory the Child , he convinces them to return to the Citadel , which has ample water and greenery that Joe keeps for himself, and trap Joe and his army in the Biker Gang's canyon.\nThe group begins the journey back to the Citadel, eventually encountering Joe and his remaining forces. A battle is waged by the two sides, and Furiosa is gravely wounded in the process. Joe positions his car in front of the Rig in an attempt to slow it down, while Max fights Joe's eldest son, Rictus Erectus ( Nathan Jones ). Toast the Knowing is captured and put on Joe's car, but she is able to distract him, allowing Furiosa to hook Joe's mask to his car's rotating wheels, tearing his lower jaw off and instantly killing him. Nux sacrifices himself by destroying the Rig, blocking the canyon, killing Rictus, and allowing Max, Furiosa, and the Wives to escape in Joe's vehicle. Max donates his blood to Furiosa with the help of the Dag , to help her survive her fatal injuries.\nAt the Citadel, the citizens are overjoyed at the sight of Joe's mangled corpse, signifying the end of his despotic rule over the land. At the citizens' joyful urging, Furiosa and the Wives are raised up on a lift by the child War Boys, but Max stays behind. He and Furiosa share a glance of acknowledgment before Max disappears into the crowd.\nSpoilers end here.\nWhiley Toll\nDevelopment\nInitially conceived shortly after Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome , George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road or Mad Max 4 failed to launch on multiple occasions.\nThe initial idea\nThe idea for the next installment of Max's adventures came to Miller in 1987[citation needed] when he was crossing the street:\n“\n\"Could we make a film which is almost a continuous chase and how much can the audience apprehend from that story in terms of character, relationships, the world, the backstory and so on? And that the McGuffin, the thing that everyone's in conflict over should be human because to some extent or another we're all commodities in the world.\"\n”\n– George Miller on the very initial idea he had for Fury Road\nMiller pushed that idea out of his mind for 9 years. In 1996 the same idea came to Miller on a long plane trip across the Pacific and that is when he dreamed the storyline while in a 'hypnagogic' state. He presented his idea to his colleges and it was decided that the next installment of Mad Max is in order.\nMad Max TV series\nShortly after the release of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, George Miller was contemplating creation of Mad Max TV series [3] The role of Max was to be reprised by an Australian actor Jon Blake. Unfortunately, Blake was involved in a car accident in 1986 that left him permanently disabled [4] . Plans for a Mad Max TV series fell through. On November 6th 1995, Daily Variety printed an article revealing a \"Mad Max: The Road Warrior,'' a weekly television series based on the ``Mad Max'' movies is set to blast onto TV screens in the fall of 1996\" [5] . No further details have been revealed other than the show would not include human violence but rather vehicular combat. The idea for a TV show was brewing in the minds of both Miller and Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution. It is unknown how far the negotiations had gone, but at the time that was the fate of the new Mad Max installment.\nBrendan McCarthy\nIn 1996, Miller started to assemble his team of screenwriters and design artists, among them: Brendan McCarthy - a big fan of the Mad Max franchise and a designer of a TV series called 'ReBoot'. Brendan had sent George Miller a VHS of an episode of 'ReBoot' entitled 'Bad Bob' which was directly inspired by 'Mad Max', with a note 'Whatever happened to Max?'. Two weeks later he received a phone call from George Miller's long time producer friend - Doug Mitchell, who was impressed by that episode and being sold on the idea that computer graphics are the next best thing decided to meet Brendan McCarthy in Los Angeles to discuss a possible Mad Max TV series. Mitchell's pitch was that the series was going to be a kind of 'Xena: Warrior Princess' version of Mad Max which caught McCarthy off guard and he proposed his own ideas, but for a Mad Max movie, which Mitchell found interesting and offered McCarthy a job on the movie instead. McCarthy also caught Miller's attention after sending him (along with many other letters about Mad Max) about three pages of drawings with designs and things that ultimately found its place in the vast world part of which was seen in Fury Road. [6] [7] Early on George Miller was working with a traditional writer (repotedly it was Eric Blakeney [8] ) who was more senior and appeared to look only at the surface of the material whereas McCarthy dug deeper into the material. The writer was treating the character of Max superficially, turning him into a generic action hero with predictable lines. One day a version of the script was presented to Miller and it was really bad. Miller explained to the writer that this script is not up to par and said that McCarthy agrees with him to which the unnamed writer said \"What would he know, he's just a f***ing cartoonist\" [9] . The writer was swiftly removed from the writing process and McCarthy moved to Sydney to storyboard the movie from 1997 to 1999 becoming a co-screen writer. As it turned out, McCarthy found that Miller had already had a basic outline for the movie, in a very crude form. That basic outline included many Wives, more than five and Max expressing love for Furiosa at the very end. [10] During the writing process, the most important idea was expressed through a quote \"Engage to heal\" meaning - it was supposed to be Max's journey of regaining humanity through helping others. The ending of the movie was completely different at first, with the escaping party going further into the Wasteland. Along with George Miller they approached the movie like animation starting off with a rough draft and storyboarded it. The first rough draft was entirely story-boarded and designed by McCarthy and it took form of a mixture of a script, manifesto and design journal.\nMichael Biehn as Max, Mel Gibson's involvement\nAfter plans of a Mad Max TV show were abandoned in favor of a full feature movie, initial rumors about casting started to circulate. In 1997 Mel Gibson was offered 'obscene' amounts of money to play Max again, but his interest in reprising the role diminished after signing on to star in Lethal Weapon 4. Michael Biehn was rumored to have been approached for the role as well. [11]\nTony Wright, Mark Sexton, Peter Pound and Nico Lathouris\nEarly in 1997, Peter Pound and Mark Sexton were hired on to do storyboards and concept art. The movie was story-boarded until the 2nd act when McCarthy had to leave to do another project, leaving the entire 3rd act in the hands of George Miller and Mark Sexton who became the movie's chief storyboard artist. [12] The \"Mad Max Bible\" early design/script/manifesto document created by Brendan McCarthy and George Miller was scanned and turned into a story reel and put into sequence with motion and duration of time with help of Sexton and Pound. Peter Pound contributed over 950 storyboards and was dubbed the movie's Principal Vehicle Designer [13] . Nico Lathouris was initially hired as a script and story analyst. [14] In 1999, Tony Wright was invited to Australia to start developing storyboards for the 4th part of Mad Max. Unfortunately due to personal issues he had to abandon the project [15] . Gradually the whole writing and design team had built the movie through still pictures with a little bit of panning, just like an animatic.\n1st announcement and casting\nIn November 2001 it was announced that the script had been finished and casting had begun. Rumors again pointed at Michael Beihn, Brendan Fern, Heath Ledger and Mel Gibson as possible main actor candidates. [16] In early 2002, Nico Lathouris had received the full 3500 storyboard version of the movie along with a script. It took 10 months for Nico to deconstruct the story to understand it and start working on it with George Miller. He broke down the story into 22 sections. Lathouris connected the number 22 with the 22 Paths of The Tree Of Life from Kabbalah which also co-related with 22 cards of the Tarot. [17] He used that model to understand the journey of Max. In December 2002 it was confirmed by Miller that the script was almost finished and filming would start early in 2003. Mel Gibson was back to play the role despite his appearance being costly, but \"Worth every cent\". Gibson himself even suggested Robert Downey Jr. for the main role. [18] In January 2003 stunt crew auditions were underway. In February 2003 it was announced that the filming would begin on June 1st in Namibia and the film studio was scheduling the movie to be released on 24th of July 2004 [19] . Australian actress Georgie Shew was in talks about her role in Mad Max: Fury Road as of May 2003.\n1st delay, Iraq War\nOn February 27th 2003 Variety [20] reported on the postponing of Mad Max Fury Road due to the Iraq War just 11 weeks before filming [21] . Due to the US dollar collapse, the production lost 25% of its budget. The movie was officially stalled and entered hiatus.\nHiatus\nFrom mid 2004 to October 24th 2009, Mad Max: Fury Road had been put on hold, Miller focusing on other movies, mainly Happy Feet and Happy Feet 2. The prospect of filming Fury Road in 2005 was still on the table with or without Mel Gibson on board [22] . In 2006, the idea of casting Mel Gibson was abandoned and searching for a new actor was underway. As a result, the movie was no longer a story about an old warrior [23] , instead George Miller was set on casting Heath Ledger for the role citing him as having the same kind of wild energy that Gibson had and later Tom Hardy would have. [24] George Miller confirmed continued interest from 2006 to 2008 with more details about the planned production surfacing. In December 2008 Miller's own Dr. D digital imagery studios were listing Mad Max: Fury Road as their upcoming project.\nAnime\nIn March 2009, MTV reported a 3D Anime Mad Max movie was planned. [25] At the time it was revealed that the script was going to be partially based on Mad Max: Fury Road, but without Mel Gibson voicing Max and the anime itself was going to be geared more towards the Western sensibilities and audiences.. Much later, in 2015 George Miller revealed that the anime was going to be about Furiosa's story and the decision to make that feature came from extensive backstories written for Fury Road by Miller and his co-writers: Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris during Fury Road's production hiatus. Two additional stories about Max were mentioned to have been written during that time. Furiosa's 3D anime was still considered until the 2nd delay due to heavy rains in Australia - the production crew immediately had to shift focus to film the movie and the concept of Mad Max anime was abandoned. [26] Concept drawings and artwork made by Mahiro Maeda for the anime resurfaced in a Japanese television program in June 2015. [27] [28] [29]\nVideo Game\nIn very early stages of Fury Road's writing process, Mark Sexton created conceptual designs of the Mad Max computer game. That game was going to be developed by George Miller's own studio. [30] The plans for the game were set aside until the movie re-emerged from its hiatus. In September 2008 - shortly before announcing plans for Mad Max 3D anime - George Miller partnered with \"God Of War II\" designer - Cory Barlog to develop a Mad Max game tie-in for the upcoming animated feature [31] . In 2010, Barlog starts working for Avalanche Studios and is rumored to have brought in his Mad Max project. Due to the 2nd delay and filming relocation, the original game project is put on hold and Barlog leaves Avalanche Studios in 2012. In 2013 the game development resumes for but Barlog reported that the final game is not what he was working on with George Miller as the game is not a tie-in to the franchise but it took on its own direction ever since. [32] A remnant of the original video game and movie tie-in was the lack of the rear spoiler on Max's Interceptor in Fury Road - the rear spoiler was supposed to be a bonus item found in the game. [33]\n2nd announcement and filming location\nOn October 24th 2009, Mad Max: Fury Road was officially announced at a press conference for the second time. [34] [35] [36] [37] The pre-production commenced and the 30-week shoot was scheduled to begin in August 2010. The location of filming was now Broken Hill and Sydney. The production would be largely financed by the New South Wales government [38] who have provided the Redfem carriage works free of charge for the film's production along with other government financial incentives. [39] The budget of the film was outstanding due to a huge amount of stunts that haven't been done before. [40] At the time of the announcement no casting choices had been revealed, but Charlize Theron's and Tom Hardy's involvement was confirmed shortly after. [41] Mel Gibson's any involvement was denied by himself. Vehicles were being built and tested in Broken Hill shortly after.\n2nd delay, Broken Hill location problems\nIn November 2011 the production in Australia was forced to stall the production once again due to heavy rains in Broken Hill which have turned the landscape from desert-like into a lush collection of wildflowers, obviously inappropriate for the \"post-apocalyptic wasteland\" [42] . George Miller decided to wait a little for the green landscape to go back to normal, but seeing as that would not happen, the production crew started contemplating other locations such as China and Chile because they had the same coast as the west coast of Africa [43] .\nFilming in Namibia\nUltimately the production was moved to Namibia in 2012 because the existing infrastructure in the coast area would make filming easier. It was announced that the film would begin shooting in 2012. The production encountered a few problems, namely from The Namibian Coast Conservation and Management group that accused the producers of damaging parts of the Namib Desert and endangering a number of plant and animal species. Another issue came up in the middle of shooting when Warner Brothers decided to remove The Citadel sequences and announced the release sometime in 2013. Those sequences were eventually put back in and after finishing filming in Namibia in on December 17th 2012, George Miller proceeded with filming The Citadel sequences in Sydney in November 2013 as planned. The shooting took 138 days. After finishing the shoot, post-production began and the final release date was announced: May 15, 2015 for the USA, & May, 14 for Australia. [44] [45]\nComic books\nMiller had always envisioned the film to be one giant road war, a unique screen spectacle that had not been attempted before. That being said, he still constructed in-depth back stories for all the major characters. The backstories of Nux , Immortan Joe , Max Rockatansky and Imperator Furiosa became the focus of a comic book series collected into a trade paperback release in August 2015. [46]\nProduction video"

    "content": "Mad Max 2 / The Road Warrior Filming Locations\nMad Max 2 / The Road Warrior Filming Locations\nA guide to the filming locations used in Mad Max 2 / The Road Warrior.\nMad Max 2 was filmed in New South Wales (Australia), around the areas of Broken Hill and Silverton.\nThe first stop for any Mad Max tourist should of course be the Silverton Hotel, pictured above. There is a wealth of history surrounding the hotel, and inside you will find pictures from Mad Max 2, and many of the other productions that have been done out there over the years. The road out past Silverton will also take you to the Mundi Mundi plain, where much of the opening of the film was shot.\nNote that several Broken Hill residents managed to keep various items from the film, and if you ask around you should be able to find them and look at these things for yourself. All that they ask is that if you take a look, please leave things as you find them, for everyone else to see after you.\nFor those unable to make it to Broken Hill - a way to visit the locations interactively is through http://earth.google.com . Visit the web site and download the package, then come back here and grab the file of Mad Max 2 locations . Just open it up by double clicking. Any locations listed as (approx) aren't pinpointed precisely yet, and many are missing, so feel free to send me your updates .\n \nMad Max 2 / Road Warrior Locations\nOpening Sequence\nThe road out past Silverton, towards   Mundi Mundi plain,   was used in many shots, primarily the opening chase, and the final truck   wreck. The truck is initially parked at the Mundi Mundi lookout (note that the   sign was a film prop, and is not there).\nThe reverse   side of the hill is used in the opening chase, where Max dodges the wrecks,   while the Landau just crashes through them. Down from the Mundi Mundi   lookout is a tight corner, which is where the truck is crashed off the road in   the final scene.\nLooking up the hill towards Mundi Mundi lookout\nAround the corner and onto the straight, and this road is   again used in the opening chase. Note in the opening chase that you can see   the cars fly past some old electrical poles, about when the Landau is knocking   posts out of the ground. The poles are still there, as pictured below.\nMundi Mundi Road, as used in the opening chase, looking towards the   corner\n \nThe Gyro Captain\nThe location of the parked Gyro Copter is Stephen's Creek.   If you take Kaolin street out of town (I hope that's the one!) and keep   driving for half an hour or so, you should reach the dry creek bed where this   scene was film. It would be advisable to take a 4 wheel drive, to avoid   becoming bogged in the sandy creek bed.\n \nThe Compound\nThe compound was set out at \"The Pinnacles\", a   series of three hills, about 20km   out of Broken Hill. The Pinnacles are fairly prominent as you drive in   towards Broken Hill, they are the only hills for miles around. The compound   was at the base of the middle pinnacle, which is the one closest to the road.   Max also used the middle pinnacle as his vantage point to overlook the   compound. After its explosive destruction seen   in the film , the compound site was bulldozed flat, but from atop The   Pinnacles you can still see the scars where it once was.\nThe road to the pinnacles was used in the rig delivery,   the road up towards the compound was actually created for the film, and is   still there today.\n \nMax Escapes In The Interceptor\nThe \"rollover\" scene, when Max gets taken out by Wez,   was on the road to Menindee lakes, not that far out of town, (at closest approx.   15 k's) a   drop to another plain.  It's apparently easy to find, you're coming down a noticeably   large hill, then it's flat until the rivers and lakes. On the right hand side of the   road (going out of town) there is a cliff face.  After the filming you could still   see the tyre tracks, etc leading off the edge. (Thanks to Josh   Nixon for this one)\n \nThe Final Chase\nThe majority of the final chase was filmed on the road from Broken Hill to Menindee. Follow the road out past the section used for the cannonball stunt, and head out about a further 15km. You'll hit a long straight stretch of road (about 4km long), which was reused back and forth for much of the chase..\n \nThe Chase Conclusion\nThe end of the final chase was mostly shot out at Mundi Mundi, on the road out past Silverton. The Gyro Captain throws the molotov cocktail at Humungus about 500 metres after the corner where the truck crashes (see below). They are heading north towards the Umberimberka reservoir. When Humungus is on fire, he is about 2km out from the truck crash corner, heading south.\n \nThe Truck Crash\nThe final truck roll over scene was just down from the Mundi Mundi lookout,   as mentioned above (same locations as for the opening chase).\nThe impact itself occurs just as the hill starts to drop down   from the Mundi Mundi lookout. In the truck crash picture shown above, the   lookout is just over the crest of the hill, behind the F100. After destroying   Humungus' truck, the truck careers down the hill, and leaves the road and hits   the dirt as it rounds the corner, shown below. See the separate page for more   detailed information on the truck stunts themselves .\nGiven that most of Mad Max 2 was shot on open roads,   the above general info is probably just about all that there is!  However, if anyone can   think of anything else, please just contact me .   I will try to identify and photograph a few of the other identifiable   locations next time I manage to make it out there.\n \nBroken Hill Tours\nAs far as I can determine, there are no tour   companies that do a specific \"Mad Max\" tour. The majority of people   venture to Broken Hill to see the area in general, and incorporate more sight   seeing than just Mad Max locations. Some tours will of course take you past   some locations and point them out, however you are probably best to make your   own way there if Mad Max is all you want to see.\nIf you want just a general tour of Broken Hill,   I have discovered a couple of companies online, perhaps email them for more   info (I have not dealt with any of these companies directly myself):\nFirstly, there is Outback Tours, http://www.outbacktours.net/ . They   mention the fact that Mad Max was filmed around Broken Hill on their page, although I   don't know if they tour to any of the locations specifically.\nSecondly, there is Goanna Safari, http://www.goanna-safari.com.au/ .   It seems that their tours are aimed directly at people who wish to see the bush, wildlife,   etc, and it is highly unlikely that they would have tours aimed specifically at Mad Max   locations. They do have tours that go through the Broken Hill area though, if you just   wanted to see that area in general.\nFinally, a couple of people have pointed out to me that   although some tour operators do offer tours of film locations in the Broken Hill area, the   information on these tours may not be 100% accurate. If you make the effort to go to   Broken Hill then I would suggest taking the above list of locations, so that if you do go   on a tour that doesn't take you everywhere, at least you can hire a car or something and   find the rest for yourself."

People know this. They’ll probably pay to see it since it feels familiar. Here’s $100 million! But with Mad Max: Fury Road, George Miller has awakened a slumbering action giant to give us everything we didn’t know we needed from a summer blockbuster in 2015. That’s right: The creator and writer/director of all three Max flicks is back to shepherd his hero into the new millennium.\nBut the last time we saw Max Rockatansky, it was 1985. Back then, Mel Gibson was young, beautiful and not at all a pariah. He was facing down a villain in the form of Tina Turner and fighting for his life in the Thunderdome. His story felt like it had reached its logical conclusion. A forever broken-hearted, noble man wandering in the desert was left to wander some more. But George Miller, Max’s creator, never stopped thinking about him, and now has a whole new set of adventures for this solitary warrior, the first of which (or rather, the fourth) is this weekend’s Fury Road.\nThat means that if you haven’t seen the original trio of movies—or maybe you just haven’t seen them in three decades—you have some catching up to do. We’re here for you. Cue up Verdi’s “Requiem, Dies irae” and get ready for a crash course in Max. Here are all the answers you’ll need before blazing down Fury Road.\nWho Is Max Rockatansky?\nThe Max we’ll see in Fury Road really appeared for the first time in The Road Warrior, Miller’s second installment in the Mad chronicles. But before the world turned to dust and he became a “burned out shell of a man,” Max was a father, a husband, and the most valuable member of the Main Force Patrol—a kind of Highway Patrol existing to enforce what remains of the law in a decaying society. In the first Mad Max movie, Rockatansky loses his partner, Jim “Goose” Rains, then his wife, Jessie, and his infant son, called only Sprog, thanks to a tangle with a nasty motorcycle gang. It’s from these events that the Max we know today is brought forth, a man with nothing and no one, but armed with a preternatural ability to survive. Max is no hero, but somehow he always ends up doing hero’s work: defending the defenseless. It’s something he proved in Road Warrior and again in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.\nConsidering the catalyst for Fury Road’s epic chase is the rescuing of a group of sex slaves from Immortan Joe’s psychotic clutches, Max is once again thrust into the role of reluctant savior in this latest chapter. As much as he projects the absence of a conscience to the cold, cruel world around him—and as much as he fears he has truly lost his soul—Max always comes through with a getaway car when the fires are burning hot and the weak need saving. Just don’t expect him to make a big deal of it.\nWhat Caused Earth to Become a Wasteland?\nThe voiceovers in the trailers for Fury Road actually give a more explicit description of what happened to Earth than any of the previous Max movies ever did. Max says his world is “fire and blood” and a newscaster’s voice mentions “the water wars.”\nIn the original Mad Max, the setting doesn’t look like our elaborate dystopias of today with everyone wearing tattered yet fashionable knits and dictators living in luxury amidst the general squalor. It’s mostly like the Wild West reborn in Australia. Lawmen play judge, jury, and executioner, and small-town folk keep to themselves, trying to get by while defending against invading gangs (just replace men on horseback with men on motor bikes). Infrastructure is crumbling and some sort of energy crisis has forced everyone into a competition for resources, hence all the raiding parties. But people still wear proper clothes and can go home and wash their hands, so it hasn’t all gone to hell just yet.\nBy Road Warrior, five years after the events of the first movie, everything has gotten considerably worse. Towns have disappeared and society consists of isolated collectives scrounging for fuel and water. Humanity has divided into three types of people: marauders, people living in small groups just trying to get by, and solo wanderers like Max. There are no more bars or ice cream shops like in Mad Max, and the clothing, cars, and homes all look like they’ve been salvaged from some sort of wreckage. If humanity is to carry on, we seem to have lost all hope of looking like the first world ever again.\nThen came Beyond Thunderdome. At this point, we are 20 years removed from the events of the first movie and people have organized in the wasteland enough to form Barter Town, a walled-off city of sorts where people can trade and indulge in countless forms of vice. (The Atoll commerce hub in Waterworld probably took its cues from Barter Town.) Even though it’s populated by rapists, thieves, and pillagers, the Town is the closest thing we’ve seen to civilization since the world was sent on a path to hell decades before. And in a trilogy set mostly in rural Australia, we finally get to see what remains of the cities at the end of Beyond Thunderdome. It’s not good. Everything looks like a volcano erupted and blew it apart, leaving behind nothing but an ash-covered husk. We can only assume that by Fury Road things have gotten even worse.\nSo Where Has George Miller Been the Last 30 Years?\nIf you haven’t been keeping up on the MaxVerse, Miller has strung together an eclectic career since Thunderdome in 1985, directing The Witches of Eastwick, Babe: Pig in the City, and both Happy Feet movies. Not what you’d expect, right? But Miller also has been mulling over Max since he finished up with Gibson all those years ago. But it had to be right if he was going to resurrect his landmark franchise, and it took more than 30 years for all the creative and financial pieces to fall into place. The massive upside to this is that Miller already has two more Max movies living inside his head. So if Fury Road is successful enough to warrant sequels, the saga could go on for at least two more movies. (The prospect is so exciting we almost don’t want to say it out loud for fear of jinxing the whole thing, but here we are.)\nIs Mel Gibson in This Movie at All?\nNo.\nThe original plan did include Gibson climbing back into the Interceptor, but the original plan also had Fury Road coming out a decade ago. When Miller first tried to get his movie off the ground around 2000, Gibson was still his guy, his road warrior, if you will. But after 9/11, the economy vaporized. The budget ballooned and production was forced to a halt. By the time Miller was able to get the wheels turning again, Gibson had fallen out of the public’s favor for allegedly saying anti-Semitic/racist/sexist things , and as Miller told the Huffington Post at South by Southwest, “it also definitely got to the stage where it wasn’t like Unforgiven, where it plays with an older guy. It was definitely the younger guy, the same guy.”\nWarner Bros.\nAnd so we get Tom Hardy as our new Viking of the Outback. And thank God. Never mind the fact that Gibson is a non-starter these days, Hardy has that cool, quiet, man-with-a-code aura that made Max such a charismatic, enduring figure all those decades ago. Max has always been a man of few words, and last year Hardy made a movie that took place entirely in the driver’s seat of an SUV and turned in one of the most compelling performances of 2014. Give this guy a chair in front of a camera and he’ll bleed for you, so imagine the presence he’ll command with more than $100 million in resources backing him up.\nWarner Bros.\nWhat’s with the Crazy Names?\nIf you’ve been reading about Fury Road you’ve seen some pretty weird character names, like Imperator Furiosa, Immortan Joe (above), Toast the Knowing, The People Eater, and Rictus Erectus, to name only a few. Miller created this world in his head from scratch, and distinctive character names are a signature of the franchise, with highlights like Mudguts, Clunk, and Toecutter showing up in Mad Max; The Humumgus, Wez and Curmudgeon appearing in Road Warrior; and Aunty Entity (the incomparable Tina Turner), Pig Killer, Dr. Dealgood, and Scrooloose in Beyond Thunderdome. It’s just how the world works.\nAre These Movies Just a Bunch of CGI?\nNope. Miller has a rich history of real people doing real stunts throughout his Mad Max movies. He kept with tradition for Fury Road, executing the vast majority what you’ll see in-camera—no CGI necessary. We’ve got a big old story here that will tell you all about it."

    "content": "Where are all the black people in Mad Max: Fury Road? Well… | Scott Woods Makes Lists\nScott Woods Makes Lists\nEverything but laundry and groceries.\nMenu\nSWoods / May 30, 2015\nAnalysis of the numerous roles of women in Mad Max: Fury Road is making some people ask the question, “Where are all the black people in the future?” It’s not a bad question, but it’s a question that, if you’re going to bother interrogating an action film set in a post-apocalyptic future with any earnestness, has some data we should apply to it first. There is the obvious answer to the question, the second most obvious answer, and a third, purely scientific answer.\nThe first and most obvious answer is that director George Miller has it in for people of color, meaning he doesn’t want them in his film, meaning he’s racist. I’m not inclined to go with an answer to that question that disparages the man who gave us Tina Turner as “Aunty Entity” thirty years ago, which, honestly? Should negate this question entirely.\nOh wait: there’s another one behind her.\nBut, still allowing for the question despite that fact, here’s another fact that negates the absolutist tone of the question: there are at least two people of color in MMFR of note (meaning with lines or action): “Toast the Knowing” (Zoe Kravitz) and “Cheedo the Fragile” (Courtney Eaton, who is just not-white enough that you can next find her playing an Egyptian slave coming soon ). Also on the table is “The Valkyrie”, portrayed by an actress (Megan Gale) of some percentage of Maori lineage, but people far more Australian than I have argued against citing her in the same breath because her inclusion is more ethnically cursory than promoted (meaning that’s information you have to look up to know, not offered by characterization). So if you’re one of those people who likes to question the diversity of things they haven’t interacted with solely based on random headlines, the short answer is “they’re in Acts 2 and 3”.\nBut let’s say you’re not looking for a political fight. Let’s say you’re actually wondering how the Mad Max universe operates in terms of race, what it’s continuity might consist of. That leaves us with the equally theoretical – and slightly more fun – exercise of science.\nSo let’s start with some facts:\nAll of the Mad Max films take place in Australia. That’s not just where they shot the films because Hollywood is expensive: these are actually Australian stories. As of 2014 Australia had 23.5 million people in it.  That’s 3 million LESS than Texas in the same year. So we’re already working with a country that doesn’t have a lot of people in it of ANY color. Australia literally has  more kangaroos than people .\nHow many of them (Australians, not kangaroos) aren’t white is key here. The Australian census didn’t count most (or any) POCs until the 1960s, and the numbers have fluctuated as the legal definition of terms like “native”, “aboriginal” and “white” have changed over the years. If you’re a black or Native American ( or both, recently ) you’re already kind of familiar with this kind of fuzzy legalese. At any rate, the percentage of black POCs in Australia is likely around 2.5 – 3 percent.\n(EDIT: I should note here that while Australia has a good number of immmigrants who claim a variety of ethnicities and points of origin, they overwhelmingly come from the UK and Asia, not countries where black people are prominent. My goal here is to figure out where the black people are in the future, so I’ll be focusing on numbers that draw that information out.)\nKnow what the percentage of Native Americans are in Texas? In 2013 it was 1 percent. So Americans, here’s an exercise: triple the number of Native Americans you saw today in your head (for most of you that number will be zero) and realize that’s how many black people of color Australia has. For fun, let’s put a whole number to that percentage. 3 percent of 23.5 million Australians is 705,000 black Australians of color. That’s it.\nNow let’s talk about where they live, because this will be on the test later when we start blowing things up.\nThe urbanization rate is how many people live in cities versus rural or remote areas. The percentages of Australian blacks breaks down thus: almost one-third – 31 percent – of them live in major cities. Another 45 percent live in regional areas. 24 percent live in remote areas. For the record, that’s 218,550 in cities, 317,250 in regional areas around cities, and 169,200 in remote areas. If you packed MetLife Stadium for a New York Giants game three times you’d have more people than Australia has blacks living in all of its major cities combined. It’s the Giants, so good luck with that, but that’s the math.\nNow apply dystopian dysfunction.\nThe first Mad Max film isn’t post-apocalyptic; it’s dystopian. No one’s dropped a bomb on anything yet in that film, and there’s still a functioning society to speak of; it just sucks. It’s a really rough place to live.\nThis was their police chief and he’s already in uniform. You do the math.\nSo we can assume that, whenever the film takes place in time (“A few years from now…” is the opening), the population is roughly what it is now while we’re all still civilized and not running over each other with motorcycles for breakfast. There weren’t any POCs in that film either, but it was a small international affair, with a cozy cast of aw-shucks ne’er-do-wells…nothing as expansive as the other films. Basically, it was all white just like every other film about a marauding band of bikers who kill a cop’s family in 1979.\nNow: drop nuclear bombs on top of everything.\nThe Road Warrior (or Mad Max 2 if you’re not an American) is a whole ‘nother ballgame. We have a full-blown apocalypse now, a complete unraveling of society and infrastructure, and the nuclear war to prove it. So let’s talk about bombs for a second.\nAustralia is 2.9 million square miles to America’s 3.7 million. Australia has a pretty small population but it’s big. And as you might imagine, its major population centers – mostly urban – would be utterly destroyed by nuclear war.\nI really hope I didn’t spoil a 33-year-old movie for anyone.\nOne nuclear bomb of almost any yield would be bad enough to decimate any city it was dropped on. A nuclear war would drop multiple bombs in key population zones, and if you did that to Australia the cost of life would be beyond devastating: dropping a single W-78 Minuteman (350 kt) on Melbourne is approximately 147,000 people gone instantly, with almost half a million more injured. Sydney is 208,000 dead/525,000 injured. With just those two bombs you could kill or otherwise incapacitate 1.3 million Australians of only 23.5 million to begin with.  Just two bombs, just one day. (Here, you can play at home …IF YOUR CONSCIENCE CAN STAND IT.)\nAnd the people of color?\nRemember: 76 percent of Australian blacks live in major cities or regional areas. That’s 535,800 out of the already meager 705,000 gone on day one, or shortly after. You only have 169,200 left to populate all of Australia…which is almost the size of America if you trim off a few states. By the time Tina Turner is utterly SLAYING Bartertown in that hundred pound chainmail dress and Charlize Theron is basically owning both lanes of Fury Road we’ve had decades of fallout, a lack of anything resembling services of any kind, radioactivity, and general bad behavior ruling the land.\nSo the question shouldn’t even be “Where are all the people of color in Mad Max Fury Road?” The question should be, “How did we ever buy Tina Turner in one of these films?” The most purely logical, shortest and coldest-ass answer to the question of where are all the black people in Mad Max: Fury Road decades after a nuclear war on Australia is, “They’re dead and you’d be lucky to see even one.”\nNow, if you want to get mad about the number of black people that are missing in a movie, be mad at It Follows : that flick was shot in Detroit and had almost zero black people in it, and that was before anybody dropped a bomb on it (unless you count gentrification . Boom!).\nShe got killed quicker than any black person in any horror film ever. PROGRESS.\nP.S.) Now, I need to say this out loud out the gate: this article does not negate the responsibility of a film endeavoring to be diverse to actually be diverse, such as this film does. This is just some nerd gaming. Plenty of other articles about how diverse it is or isn’t, and how that’s working.\nP.P.S.) I’ve been chided for not putting enough actual lists here, so here is my list of Mad Max films in order of how good they are:\n1) The Road Warrior"

What most people don't realize is that the Bronx has more parkland than any of the other boroughs, quaint seaside towns and possibly one of the coolest Little Italy's anywhere.\n2 Brooklyn\nIt's been said that you're not a true New Yorker (or have never really visited New York) until you've walked across the famous Brooklyn Bridge. How is it that a bridge has come to decide such matters? Well, 1) walking the bridge gives you one of the best city views you'll ever have, and 2) it takes you straight into Brooklyn—home of Brooklynites, Brooklynese (that oh-so-lovable accent), art, culture and just about everything else. Everyone seems to have their own reason for loving Brooklyn, and we happily encourage you to check it out and find yours.  [Photo by ugod/flickr]\n3 Manhattan\nManhattan is the most populous borough from 9 to 5 and the crazy land of big buildings, paper-thin models, bulls, bears and sky-high rent. Bars of every genre, awesome parks, countless restaurants and every business you could ever imagine make this walk-everywhere borough seem like a great, big adult Disneyland. You'll see just about everything when wandering these streets, from people sleeping on sidewalks to movie stars walking their dogs to strange art installations to people with no clothes—truly, this place is unlike any other.\n4 Queens\nThe early stomping grounds for Run D.M.C., The Ramones, Archie Bunker and Spiderman, Queens should have a special place in everyone's heart. The most diverse of all the boroughs, you can travel from Ireland to India to Italy on one subway line through Queens, and find some of the best ethnic food you'll ever have. It's also where you'll find LaGuardia and JFK Airports, the US Open and dozens of museums and art galleries.\n5 Staten Island\nThe least populated and least famous of the boroughs, poor Staten Island has earned the unfortunate nickname of \"The Forgotten Borough.\" Unlike the other boroughs, Staten Island isn't connected to central-hub Manhattan by a subway, tunnel or bridge—instead, it's the ferry. But where else could you live and say that you get to work by a free boat ride that cruises past the Statue of Liberty?  [Photo credit Roman Königshofer / flikr]"

    "content": "NYC Population\nComplete Analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Estimates for July 1, 2015\nIntroduction\nThe  U.S. Census Bureau prepares estimates of total population for all counties in  the United States on an annual basis, using a demographic procedure known as  the “administrative records method” (described below). This method assumes that  post-census population change can be closely approximated with vital statistics  data on births and deaths, along with other administrative and survey data that  provide a picture of migration patterns.\nTotal Population\nAccording  to U.S. Census Bureau population estimates, New York City’s population  increased from 8,175,1331 in  April of 2010 to 8,550,405 in July of 2015. This is an increase of 375,300 residents  or about 4.6 percent over the 2010 mark. Among the boroughs, Brooklyn saw the largest  change in population in this 63-month period, growing by 5.3 percent or 132,000  persons, followed by the Bronx (5.1 percent or 70,300 persons), Queens (4.9  percent or 108,400 persons), and Manhattan (3.7 percent or 58,600 persons). The  lowest growth occurred in Staten Island (1.2 percent or 5,800 persons).\nNew  York City’s population increase since April of 2010 represented 89.8 percent of  the total increase in New York State, which raised the city’s share of the  State’s population, from 42.2 percent to 43.2 percent.\nComponents of Population Change\nDemographers  divide population change into components.  Natural increase represents  the difference between births and deaths. Net migration represents the  balance between persons entering and leaving an area. Together, these  components describe how populations change over time. The U.S. Census Bureau  constructs population estimates for all counties in the United States by  separately estimating the components of change. Births and deaths are compiled  using data from the national vital statistics system. Net migration is  calculated by estimating the rate of net migration for persons coming in from  and leaving for other counties in the 50 states (net domestic migration)  and the balance of people who immigrate from and emigrate to other nations and  Puerto Rico (net international migration). The net domestic migration  rate is derived using income tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service and  Medicare enrollment data from the Social Security Administration (see methods  discussion below).\nIt is important to keep in mind that  New York City has a very dynamic population, with several hundred thousand  people coming and going each year. This “churn” has long characterized the City,  and represents a fluidity that is difficult to characterize using the net migration  measures presented herein. This dynamism is a testament to the City being a  magnet for those seeking opportunities, then moving on, only to be replaced by  the next set of individuals aspiring for a better life.  This very vibrant  picture is what makes New York City’s population extraordinary and different  from most other places in the nation and, perhaps, the world.\nThe most recent estimates from the U.S.  Census Bureau indicate the following for the 2010-2015 period:\na) Positive natural increase – the  surplus of births over deaths added 341,300 persons to New York City’s  population between April of 2010 and July of 2015.\nb) Net migration was positive for  the city overall, with a net migration gain of 49,600 persons for the  period.  While small by the standards of the City’s overall population, the  picture of positive net migration represents a reversal of longstanding pattern  of population losses through migration. The recent gain through migration  was the result of a net inflow of 452,500 persons through international  migration, which offset a net domestic migration loss of 402,900 persons. For  the first time in over a half-century, migration fueled population growth.\nc)   Every borough, except  Staten Island, displayed positive net migration between April 2010 and July of 2015. \nNew Patterns of Recent Growth:  2014-2015 vs. 2010-2014\nThe  robust pace of growth in the post-2010 period has not been seen since the  1920s. However, the most recent 2014-2015 estimates point to a relatively lower  growth rate as compared to 2010-2014. The increase over the past year,  2014-2015 was 55,200 or 0.6 percent, compared to 75,300 or about 0.9 percent  annual average growth for the 2010-2014 period. \nIn  the 2014-2015 period, Brooklyn experienced net outflows, a reversal of the  pattern in prior years. Growth in Brooklyn was at the City average (0.6 percent)  in the past year, while the Bronx (0.9 percent) and Queens (0.7 percent) had higher  than average growth. Indeed,  the Bronx had the highest growth of any county in New York State, while Queens  added the most people in numerical terms.\nU.S. Census Bureau Population Estimates Methodology\nEach  year, the U.S. Census Bureau produces estimates of the population for states,  counties, cities and other places, as well as for the nation as a whole. They  utilize data from a number of sources to estimate the change in the population  for each year since the most recent decennial census. These population  estimates use the 2010 Census counts as a base.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau subtracts the  number of resident deaths from the number of resident births annually for each  county in the U.S., to derive growth due to natural increase.  Births are tabulated by residence of the mother, regardless of where the birth  occurred. Similarly, deaths are tabulated by the most recent residence of the  decedent, not where the death occurred. Birth and death certificates from the  National Center for Health Statistics are used as the data source. The data on  births and deaths are generally considered to be the most reliable part of the  components of change analysis.\nNet domestic migration represents the net exchange between  a county and other counties in the 50 states. This component is estimated for three  age groups (0-17, 18-64 and 65 years and older). For ages 0 to 64, the U.S. Census  Bureau uses data on filers and dependents from federal income tax returns  supplied by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In-migrants and out-migrants  between counties as well as non-movers are identified by comparing the  addresses of income tax filers from year-to-year to determine residence at two  points in time. For example, to produce the July 1, 2015 estimates, the  addresses of tax filers in 2013 and 2014 are compared. In-migrants to a county  were defined as those with an address in the county in 2014, but outside the  county in 2013; out-migrants are those with an address in the county in 2013,  but outside the county in 2014; and individuals who filed tax returns at the  same address at both points in time are non-migrants. Since every U.S. resident  may not file or be claimed as an exemption on a tax return, these data cannot  be used to directly estimate the number of county-to- county migrants.  Instead a net domestic migration rate needs to be calculated by taking  the difference between the numbers of in- and out-migrants (net-migrants) and  dividing it by the sum of the non-movers and out-migrants.2 Because many retired persons do not file tax returns, the U.S. Census Bureau uses  addresses from Medicare enrollment data in much the same way as they use IRS  data to determine domestic migration for the population 65 years and over.\nNet International Migration is the result of net flows to and  from foreign countries and Puerto Rico and is estimated in the following parts:  immigration of the foreign-born, emigration of the foreign- as well as  native-born, and net migration between the U.S. and Puerto Rico.  Immigration of the foreign-born is estimated using the ACS question on  residence in the prior year. Foreign-born persons who indicated that they lived  abroad in the prior year are considered immigrants.\nEmigration of the foreign-born is estimated  using the residual method. For example, the foreign-born population is aged  forward to obtain the expected population in the year 2015. The expected  population is then compared to the population estimated in the 2015 ACS.  Subtracting the estimated from the expected populations provides the  residual, which then serves as the basis of emigration rates for the foreign-born.  Emigration rates of the native-born are based on research by Schachter (2008)  using data from over 80 countries.3This work compares estimates of U.S. citizens living overseas measured for two  consecutive time periods and uses the difference to develop estimates of net  native migration.\n1While there is little doubt that New York City has  experienced a substantial population increase post-2010, it is probably  overstated. Brooklyn and Queens likely experienced an undercount in the 2010  Census, the result of misclassifying housing units as vacant. A conservative  estimate is that this problem understated the population of the two boroughs by  65,000 persons. This means that the population of the city in 2010 was easily  in excess of 8,240,000 – and not the 8,175,100 base from the 2010 enumeration  that is used in the calculations of change.\nSee Salvo, J.J. and A.P. Lobo (2013). “Misclassifying New York’s Hidden Units as Vacant in 2010: Lessons Gleaned for  the 2020 Census.” Population Research and Policy Review, 32(5), 729-751.  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-013-9298-1\n2 One reason  why small changes in estimates need to be interpreted with caution relates to  the effects that tumultuous events can have on the administrative data used to  create population estimates.  Such is the  case with super storm Sandy and its impact on the utility of tax return data to  estimate migration levels for the boroughs.\n3 Schachter, Jason. 2008. “Estimating Native emigration from  the United States,” Memorandum dated December 24, delivered to the US.

Until 1898, when these counties were joined, the city of New York was only formed by Manhattan.\nAlthough each borough has a president, their role is very limited since the management is highly centralized by the Mayor of New York.

    "content": "Five Boroughs : Long Island Exchange\nUsed Cars\nFive Boroughs\nLocated just west of Long Island is a city with 5 boroughs, 59 community districts and hundreds of neighborhoods .\nThe Five Boroughs of New York: New York City is one of the biggest cities in the world, perhaps, because it is actually made up of five smaller sections called boroughs. At one time, each borough had a completely separate government because it was considered a municipal corporation. A municipal is a local governing body with its own set of governing officials. In 1898, the separate governments were united as one. The five boroughs kept their separate identities but became a part of New York City. The five boroughs are Manhattan , Brooklyn , Queens , The Bronx and Staten Island .\nEach borough has a borough president, and the borough government operates out of a borough hall like a city hall that most people associate with city officials. Manhattan is the only exception; the officials function out of the Manhattan Municipal Building. As of 1990, the borough president has very little power. At one time, each president had a voice in budget decisions within the city of New York . It was argued in the U.S. Supreme Court that the practice was unconstitutional since each borough president got one vote. The most densely populated boroughs got the same vote as the borough with the least amount of people. It violated the 14th amendment. The mayor of New York City makes all budget decisions for all the boroughs.\nManhattan: When people think New York, they often think of Manhattan . The island of Manhattan is the smallest of the five boroughs but has more people than the largest borough of New York. Manhattan is 23 square miles. That is not much space for the 1.6 million people who live there and does not take into account tourists or those that work in Manhattan but choose to live in one of the outer boroughs.\nManhattan is known for many landmarks like the Empire State Building and Central Park. The neighborhoods are varied. From Harlem with its boutiques and jazz clubs, Lower Manhattan’s cultural cuisine to the Upper East Side’s museums and Midtown’s Times Square, there is a cultural, culinary and visual experience for every visitor.\nThe Bronx: The Bronx is the second smallest of the New York boroughs at 42 square miles but has less people than Manhattan does. The 2010 census reported over 1.3 million people in The Bronx. The Bronx has more open spaces than Manhattan and could account for the amount of people.\nThere are many tree-lined streets and local parks for families that settle in this area. The South Bronx is where Yankee stadium can be found. The Bronx also boasts the Bronx Zoo with many outdoor cafes and exhibits. It is where visitors and neighbors can enjoy the New York Botanical Gardens as well.\nBrooklyn: Brooklyn is the most inhabited of the five boroughs with over 2.5 million people in 71 square miles. The many ethnic groups in Brooklyn can be found in concentrated sections around the borough. There is a large African American community in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area , Russians in the Brighton Beach area and a sizable Hispanic population in Bushwick . There is a large concentration of various other ethnic populations like the Irish, Arab Americans, Greek, Orthodox Jews and West Indians just to name a few.\nThe Brooklyn Philharmonic and the Brooklyn Academy of Music are examples of the musical traditions Brooklyn is famous for having within its borough. Another example of culture is the Brooklyn Museum which houses the second largest collection of art in the U. S.\nQueens: If Queens were a city independent of New York, it would be considered the fourth most thickly-settled city in the U. S. behind cities like Los Angeles and Chicago. Queens has a population of over 2.2 million people in 109 square miles. While it may be thought that Brooklyn is the most culturally-diverse, it is actually Queens where its residents speak over 138 languages. The area of Queens includes the major airports within its borders.\nQueens has outdoor amusements in Corona , an outdoor beer garden in Astoria and fine dining with great views in Long Island City . It has a welcoming family community in many of the areas of Queens. The borough also has many cultural attractions for the visitor that wants to explore or the full-time resident who wants to fully experience their borough.\nStaten Island: Staten Island is the least inhabited and populated of the boroughs with just over 470,000 residents. The island is 58 square miles and is separated from the other boroughs by New York Bay. The residents of Staten Island often refer to themselves as “The Forgotten Borough” since they feel ignored in favor of the other boroughs by the government of New York.\nStaten Island is accessed from New Jersey by three separate bridges , and from Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge . Most tourists want to visit Staten Island using the free Staten Island Ferry which takes the visitor on a scenic view of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island . Staten Island is becoming a haven for artists and musicians who want to be close to Manhattan but have access to affordable housing. Manhattan is less than a half an hour from Staten Island by ferry.\nLOCAL ADVERTISING\nSocial Icon"

It's no longer the forgotten borough. Staten Island has taken careful steps to improve the housing codes and upgrade public parks and shore lines.\"\nPepenella advises, \"Preparing your home for sale is a process that can really reap the reward. If your home is on the market, but no one is putting in an offer, here are some suggestions to spruce things up. First get rid of any personal photos, collections, and bric-a-brac. Its just too distracting. A fresh coat of white paint goes a long way toward making a room neutral. Clean. Forget the potpourri! Sweep, dust, vacuum, open the windows and get a big bucket of soapy water and clean from top to bottom. Highlight your home's best feature. Don't block your ocean view with dark curtains or put your couch in front of the sliding glass doors to the yard. Pack excess furniture until you move into your new place. It's worth it and will make your house sell faster and sometimes a higher price. New Yorkers are savvy buyers when it comes to real estate. Buyers will walk out of a home that is dusty, musty and needs a good old fashioned paint job and cleaning. A home that is clean and staged to sell is most desirable.\"\nRate this item"

Ecevit had ordered Turkish troops into Cyprus to protect the rights of Turkish Cypriot citizens, who were being oppressed by the Greeks. At least that was the 'truth' as seen by the Turkish journalists.\" -- Midnight Express, Billy Hayes\nOn the 20th of July 1974 Turkey invaded Cyprus.  On the 18th of November 1983 the North was unilaterally declared as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus .  A state that no other country with the exception of Turkey recognises.\nCyprus today is a divided island.  A Green Line divides the island.  On the Turkish side razor wire, minefields, watch-towers every few hundred metres.  A scene reminiscent of the Cold War and the Iron Curtain dividing East and West Germany.  Famagusta is a ghost town.  Many refugees , both Turkish and Greek Cypriots fled to the South.\nAn estimated 40-50,000 Turkish troops illegally occupy Northern Cyprus.  Possibly as many as 100,000 Turkish settlers, many against their will, have moved into Northern Cyprus.  Stories of atrocities filter across the border.  Reports filter out of systematic and widespread plunder and destruction of Greek archaeological sites.\nIt takes two to tango.  In the early 1970's Turkey was looking for an excuse to invade.  A handful of Greek Cypriots gave  Turkey that excuse.  Spurred on by a fascist military junta in Greece they mounted an abortive coup against the legitimate government of Cyprus.  With genuine fears for the Turkish Cypriot minority Turkey initially had the tacit approval of the International Community.\nIn the first invasion (20 July 1974) Turkey secured an area around Kyrenia.  In defiance of a UN Security Council resolution to withdraw its forces, Turkey mounted a second invasion on the 14th of August 1974.  Within two days, Turkey had captured more than a third of the territory of Cyprus.\nThe fascist junta in Greece has long given way to a democratic regime, the Turkish occupying forces remain in place.\nTurkey occupies 37% of the island's land. 165,000 people fled from the North of the island, not only Greek Cypriots but also Turkish Cypriots.  45,000 Turkish Cypriots were 'helped' to flee to the North by attacks by out-of-control Greek Cypriot paramilitary units and attacks by Turkish Cypriot terror units. More than 200,000 people became refugees in their own land.\nA tiny handful of Greek Cypriots remain in the North , determined not to be driven from their homes.  Many of those that remain are elderly and in their 60s, 70s and 80s.\nA steady stream of Turkish Cypriots has continued to leave the North to live abroad.  They find that their cosmopolitan world view is increasingly at odds with the repressive regime back home.  Denktash has called these migrants 'traitors', conveniently forgetting that it is his repressive regime that is driving these people to leave their own country.  A Turkish Cypriot opponent of Denktash described occupied Cyprus as 'a prison in the sun'.  He was one of many Turkish Cypriot critics of Denktash, who is seen by many Turkish Cypriots as nothing more than a puppet of Ankara.\nTourists who visit occupied Northern Cyprus describe on their return to freedom a holiday spent in a Police State - soldiers and police everywhere, watching every movement.\nTurkey is a repressive, brutal, Islamic regime, on a par with Indonesia, Iran or Iraq.  Repression against its own people is well documented. Repression of lawyers, writers, intellectuals, students, trade union officials, human rights campaigners, minority  groups within Turkey, especially Christian, Armenian, Greek and  Kurdish minorities.   Human rights groups who monitor the level  of abuse and attempt to collect evidence find themselves in turn  subjected to harassment and abuse.\nHuman rights offices are closed or threatened with closure.  Officials are threatened and intimidated.  On Tuesday 12 May 1998, Akin Birdal, head of the Turkish Human Rights Association (IHD) was gunned down at his office in Ankara.\nEarly May 1998 a sit-down protest by the Mothers of the Disappeared  was attacked by the police and those present arrested. Even this small,  low key demonstration has proved more than the repressive regime can stomach.  The protests are now banned.\nTo a hushed committee room in the House of Lords, two young lawyers gave a chilling account of their attendance as independent, international observers at a political trial in Turkey's State Security Court, April/May 1998.  The court was ringed by troops and tanks, within, the accused were faced by armed soldiers.  Those on trial were executive members of HADEP, a political party.  Their 'crime' to was speak on behalf of the Kurds.\nTo the same meeting, chaired by the eminent Lord Hylton (Moses Room, 2 June 1998), speaker after speaker highlighted the atrocities, wide scale abuses of human rights that were taking place in Turkey, the breaches of international agreements.  Calls were made for international sanctions against Turkey.  To coincide with the meeting, a damning report, documenting the widespread atrocities in Turkish occupied Kurdistan was launched.\nDuring 1996 a group of EU parliamentarians produced a damning report of Human Rights violations in Turkey and Northern Cyprus, and the lack of fundamental democratic rights.  The UK Parliamentary Group produced an equally damning report on human rights abuses and the lack of democracy.  In March 1998, the European Commission produced a report stating  'No substantial progress has been achieved as regards human rights and democratic reform', since their last report.  These are but samples of many such reports on Turkey produced by Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and other Human Rights groups.\nIn 1996, and again in 1997 the House of Lords debated human rights abuses in Turkey.  Both sessions were highly critical and carried some harrowing accounts of the abuses taking place.  The instigator of both debates, Lord Avebury, is a banned person in Turkey on account of his tireless campaigning for the oppressed in both Turkey and occupied Cyprus.\nDuring the Gulf War two RAF aircrew were shot down in a bombing raid over Iraq.  A few days later they were paraded on Iraqi TV badly beaten up and forced to 'confess' their actions.  Whatever the thoughts of Saddam Hussein, his actions were counter-productive as it hardened the resolve of the world to rid itself of Hussein.\nDuring the 1996 rout of the Kurds by Saddam Hussein one of these airmen spoke out publicly against the West's policy of protecting the Kurds.  This was not because the airman had no sympathy towards the Kurds, far from it, his attack was on the hypocrisy of the West.  One day British aircrews would be risking their lives to protect the Kurds from Iraqi incursions, the next day they would be asked to stand down to allow Turkey to carry out bombing raids against Kurdish villages.  Raids using a military machine financed and built by the West.\n14 May 1997, Turkey launched an invasion of northern Iraq.  20 May 1998, Turkey launched a second invasion.\nIn the Summer of 1996 a couple of Greek Cypriots were killed during disturbances on the neutral Green Line dividing the   illegally occupied North of Cyprus from the rest of Cyprus. In the first case demonstrators against the Turkish occupation strayed into the Turkish side.  One of the demonstrators was beaten and bludgeoned to death. Yes, they were foolish to stray across the line but that in no way justifies the brutality of the response.  A few days later, at the funeral of the first victim and with tempers running high, a cousin of the victim ran across the neutral zone, shinned up a flag pole and attempted to tear down the Turkish flag (the flag of the hated oppressor and occupier).  He was shot down in cold blood.\nA few days after the killings Turkish Foreign Secretary and ex-Prime Minister Tansu Ciller arrived on the scene.  Demonstrating that she herself was no less a thug she remarked that anyone who touched the Turkish flag would be cut down. US papers and press reports late 1996 linked Tansu Ciller to organised crime and death squads.  Members of the Turkish parliament have accused Tansu Ciller of having links and called on the State Prosecutor to investigate.\nThe killings in the Summer were not the only tragedies to take place that year.  In the Autumn a Cypriot, ironically a refugee from the occupied North,  was out collecting snails.  Foolishly he strayed into the neutral zone. He was shot dead .  He was shot dead even though he had his hands in the air in an act of surrender.  To make doubly sure several shots were fired into his body as he lay on the ground.\nDigitally enhanced pictures of the killers have been posted on the Web in attempt to bring the killers to trial.\nIn total four people were killed on the Green Line during 1996.  Earlier in the year, a Greek Cypriot National Guardsman was killed on the Green Line.\nOn Sunday 15 December 1996 UK Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind arrived in  Cyprus on a two day   visit.  He was accompanied by special envoy Sir David Hanney.  They put to the people of Cyprus a 10 Step Programme .   Noticeable by its absence was any call for Turkey to withdraw, though Rifkind did refer to this in his statements.  The 10 Steps refers to the setting up of a a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation, with give and take on all sides and the need for confidence building  between the two sides.  Rifkind emphasised that he was acting for anyone other than the UK, conveniently forgetting that the UK was and still is a guarantor of Cyprus's independence.  Putting to one  side my own reservations on the plan, Rifkind is at the very least  to be commended as the first British Foreign Secretary to visit Cyprus since the Turkish invasion  with the sole intention of attempting to resolve the Cyprus problem.\nWere Cyprus to agree to the 10 Steps it would be all give by Cyprus and all take by Turkey.  In effect it would legitimise the occupation and partition of Cyprus.\nFrom discussions with the UK Foreign Office it is all too clear their lack of understanding of the situation in Cyprus.  Their constant reference to the two communities is illustrative of this.  It is questionable whether they have anyone on the ground who understands the situation.\nWe are all hampered by the cultural baggage that we carry around with us.  How we perceive a situation very much depends upon where we are coming from.  The cultural baggage for anyone in the UK is Northern Ireland - two sharply divided communities, decades of hatred between the two communities, with no sign of that hatred diminishing, inflamed as it is by the bigots on both sides of the religious divide.\nThis is not the situation in Cyprus.  The two communities were, until recently, intermixed and lived happily side by side.  In fact it is probably a misnomer to speak of two communities.  The danger then is that we fall into the trap of referring to the Greek side of the island and the Turkish side, when what we should refer to are Cypriots (Turkish and Greek) and a free Cyprus and an occupied Cyprus.  If we don't get the semantics of the language straight then we are unlikely to move forward as we are failing to understand the situation.  Prior to the Turkish invasion and occupation, there was not one part of the island that was predominately Turkish Cypriots and another part that was predominately Greek Cypriots.\nThat is not to belittle the atrocities that have occurred between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, these should remain as part of the historical record if for no other reason than as a warning of what can occur when things go wrong.  Nor should we overlook the need to establish constitutional rights for minorities and ensure that every citizen defends and upholds those rights.\nThe situation in Cyprus is not that of two sharply divided communities, it is that of an independent country, part of whose territory is currently occupied by a repressive regime.\nThe Turkish Cypriots living in the North do not see the Turks as liberators as is so often claimed by Turkey, on the other hand we should not underestimate their fear and trepidation at re-integration with the rest of Cyprus with the knowledge of inter-ethnic atrocities still within living memory. The withdrawal of Turkish troops would require their replacement with Nato Bosnia style peace-keepers as part of the confidence building measures.\nCypriots have patiently stood by, sometimes not so patiently when frustrations erupt into mad demonstrations, but on the whole they have been prepared to rely on the world seeing the justice of their case.  The world has conveniently looked the other way.  There are signs that this patience is wearing very thin and will soon be at an end.  The rest of the world walks on by.  Attempts to buy arms  on the World market (tanks and missile systems) is not the answer.  Apart from the downside of a slide from angry confrontation to armed conflict there is the very real possibility of Turkey mounting a pre-emptive strike before the missiles are in place. It should be made very clear to Turkey that a pre-emptive strike would result in very serious consequences for Turkey. Cyprus has a thriving tourist industry, so once did Lebanon and Yugoslavia.  Does Cyprus really want to be reduced to another Lebanon or Yugoslavia?\nThe way forward is a propaganda offensive in the West and Russia against Turkey.  Turkey is no friend of the West , neither is Turkey a friend of Russia.  Turkey is active with Iran and Iraq in attempting to form an Islamic Common Market.  It has been active in attempting to destabilise Russia's southern republics, within Russia it has provided military support to Chechan separatists.  It has been meddling in the Balkans, in particular Bosnia, Kosovo and Albania.\nIn the early hours of Wednesday 18 December 1996 BBC World Service reported a statement by the Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan of his intentions to  establish a defence pact with Iran.\nIf the will existed Turkey could be kicked out of Cyprus overnight.  Cyprus has to be far more pro-active in putting its case to world opinion and in highlighting that in backing Turkey the world is backing the wrong horse.  Cyprus has to emphasise that it is a Western democracy with a cosmopolitan world view  and contrast that with Turkey and in particular highlight the lack of democracy and human rights abuses that are the norm for Turkey.\nPost-Cold War offers an unparall"

From the platform, tourists overlook the no man's land and the Turkish part of the island.\nOn Thursday March 8, 2007 the government of the Southern Greek part of Cyprus used heavy machinery to allow its military to tear down the five-meter high concrete wall on the Green Line that divides the island.\nThe wall has stood in the Cyprus capital of Nicosia for more than 40 years. It has been a constant reminder of the political situation of the Mediterranean island (given independence from Britain in 1960) that has suffered divisions since communal violence in 1963 that was only prevented by establishing a United Nations Peacekeeping Force there in 1964. These divisions only deepened when Cyprus was invaded by Turkey’s military in mid-July 1974 after right-wing Greek Cypriots (backed by the military junta ruling Greece at the time) attempted a coup with the intent of joining the island to Greece. The result was a split between the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government in the south and the Turkish Cypriot north (only recognized by Turkey ). The division at Nicosia has become a curiosity to tourists who look over it to see the buffer zone between the two factions (a no man’s land with abandoned homes and businesses where no civilians are allowed). The destruction of the wall also brought out curious Cypriots.\nMuch international pressure had been brought to bear on both sides, and thawing of the relationship between the opposing Cypriots began in 2003 when the Turkish side eased restrictions on travel. Still in 2004 before joining the E.U. , Greek Cypriots rejected the UN reunification plan that called for a federation of two states. Then in December 2005 when the Turkish Cypriots created a footbridge for Turkey’s soldiers on the other side, the action drew protests from the Greek Cypriots voicing their security concerns. In January 2007 the Turkish Cypriots began dismantling the footbridge as a gesture of good faith.\nAt first both Cypriot governments expressed hope of reunification when asked about the demolition. Tassos Papadopoulos , the president in the Greek south stated \"Tonight we have demolished the checkpoint on our side.” He went on to call for the Turkish Cypriots to act, saying civilians will not be able to cross “if the troops are not withdrawn”. Rasit Pertev, chief adviser to Mehmet Ali Talat , the leader of Turkish Cyprus said: \"This is extremely symbolic... The dynamism created by this move will lead to the opening of the crossing.\" Still when the government of Turkey dismissed the move as merely a result of international pressure that did not signify anything, and refused to dismiss its troops in the area (it maintains 40,000 soldiers on the island), sheets of aluminum were put up as a barricade on the Greek Cypriot side early on the morning of March 9, 2007.\nSources"

    "content": "Cyprus divided: 40 years on, a family recalls how the island was torn apart | World news | The Guardian\nThe Observer\nCyprus divided: 40 years on, a family recalls how the island was torn apart\nThe award-winning Observer correspondent who covered the 1974 Turkish invasion returns to the rocky battleground with one Greek Cypriot guardsman he met in the conflict\nSaturday 5 July 2014 19.04 EDT\nFirst published on Saturday 5 July 2014 19.04 EDT\nShare on Messenger\nClose\nOn the outskirts of a mountain village in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus , Lakis Zavallis, 72 in September, is scrambling about a rocky roadside hillside looking for an imitation-leather grip he had first used when he was a law student in London in the early 60s.\nSome 40 years ago he was a lieutenant commanding a diminishing platoon of weary Greek Cypriot National Guardsmen when he hid the bag under the overhang of a rock. They had just been ordered to make what he thought might be a temporary withdrawal from a forward position and he wanted to lighten his load. In it was the English paperback edition of Solzhenitsyn's Cancer Ward and a sweater, for even during the island's scorching summers the Kyrenia range gets chilly at night when you're dodging mortar bombs by living in a hole in the ground.\nBeneath the book and the sweater is the item that makes Lakis persist in trying to find his bag. This was his second attempt this year and there have been others. In it is the diary he kept when he found himself part of a shambolic home guard doing its best to take on Nato's biggest army in cold war Europe and one that came with the kind of air and naval support intended to take on the Soviet Union.\nThis month sees the 40th anniversary of Operation Attila, Turkey's codename for its invasion of Cyprus. It started on 20 July 1974 and ended almost a month later on 16 August. By then, its forces occupied just over a third of the island in the name of a Turkish Cypriot minority not quite a fifth of its total population. They still do, though May's visit by US vice-president Joe Biden has raised hopes that the elusive settlement to the Cyprus problem might at last be in the offing, if only to divide the spoils of newly discovered offshore natural gas and oil.\nOn 15 July 1974, a coup against Archbishop Makarios III, president of Cyprus since 1960 when it stopped being a British colony, was orchestrated by the military junta in Athens who wanted what Greek speakers call enosis. This was the same political union with Greece desired by the Eoka guerrillas who in the late 1950s fought the British under Georgios Grivas, a Cypriot-born Greek army officer. The coup gave Ankara all the reasons it ever needed to launch Operation Attila, which came five days later.\nAbout 650 officers in the 15,000- strong Greek Cypriot National Guard were professional soldiers from the junta's Greece. Their passion for enosis was rejected by those Makarios supporters who preferred a Cyprus that was a world away from the weird fascists then ruling democracy's birthplace. Dissenting conscripts got into trouble. In 1972 Doros Zavallis, Lakis's youngest brother who had tasted life under the colonels as a law student in Athens, returned to Cyprus to do his national service. When he was overheard criticising a speech made by an officer, warning them they should be ready to intervene if Makarios took a wrong turn, he was accused of being a communist, given 20 days' detention and sent to a remote coastal outpost monitoring a Turkish enclave.\nThese enclaves were guarded by the Turkish Cypriots' own militia, established during a period of inter-communal reciprocal slaughter between 1963 and 1967. Enosis was anathema to them. Their own extremists responded with another single-word slogan: taksim. It meant partition.\nChildren play in a park next to a fence marking the United Nations buffer zone in a partially restricted area in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled area of central Nicosia, 2014. Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters\nThe coup was the culmination of a decade of fratricidal Greek Cypriot strife. Athens backed the septuagenarian Grivas, hero of the struggle against the British, who secretly returned to his native island from Greece and set up his Eoka B. Makarios responded by creating a praetorian guard he called the Tactical Police Reserve. When in January 1974 Grivas died of a heart attack, thousands attended his funeral in Limassol and Eoka B, armed by the junta, carried on. But it was some of the National Guard's ancient T-34 tanks, a gift from Russia, that fired the coup's opening shots at the presidential palace. The archbishop had already survived several assassination attempts and his luck held. He escaped to Paphos, his birthplace, from where a British helicopter took him to RAF Akrotiri on the sovereign bases. By the time the Turks had landed, he was already in New York and had just addressed the UN security council.\nOn the morning of the invasion Lakis Zavallis, driving a blue Morris Traveller used by his family's printing business in Nicosia, went to the village of Paleiometocho near the capital's airport where he was to report for duty with 366 Reserve Battalion. Names were being taken in a school. It took about 30 minutes and on his way he overtook some of the National Guards' Stalingrad-era T-34s. As he overtook them, the commanders in their open turrets smiled and waved. It was about 8am and the sky was full of contrails made by Turkish Skyhawks. Soon they would be falling on the personnel carriers of the Greek Cypriots' only armoured infantry battalion and kill their commanding officer.\nLike most Nicosians, he had been woken shortly after dawn by gunfire, explosions and low-flying aircraft. He had got to the roof of his apartment block with his Super 8 camera in time to film the Turkish paratroops dropping to reinforce the Turkish Cypriot enclave north of the city. Then he got together what bits of uniform he could find, kissed his wife Anita and their two young sons goodbye and left.\nIn theory, the Greek Cypriots had in mind the kind of mass mobilisation the Israelis did so well. But Makarios had never dared allow an exercise involving the full call-up of reservists, for fear its Greek officer corps would march them to the presidential palace and dethrone him. Now thousands of Greek Cypriot men were clamouring for the chance to defend their island until the Greeks or the UN or both came to their rescue. They were of both factions, for the coupists had opened the jails and let out all the Makarios supporters they had rounded up, some of them looking rather the worse for wear. \"Of course, that was before most of them had come under fire,\" recalled Lakis. \"But there was a lot of enthusiasm. What was lacking was the apparatus to equip and absorb them.\"\nHis two brothers turned up at a reporting centre a couple of minutes' walk from the Zavallis family home where their widowed mother lived. Doros, despite the treatment he received as a conscript, grabbed the last Lee-Enfield rifle from a truck full of small arms and was soon part of a unit heading north. Sophocles, the middle brother who had attended Leeds College of Technology, missed out on the last weapons' distribution and was never mobilised. This turned into very bad luck indeed. During the first and very loosely observed ceasefire he tried to find his brothers. Turkish soldiers shot up his car and he ended up in a mainly Turkish Cypriot ward in the British hospital at Dhekelia being treated for four bullet wounds.\nMeanwhile, Lakis and Doros went separately off to war. Doros became the ammunition carrier for a heavy machine gun team but he did occasionally use his Lee-Enfield. Neither he nor his brother had fired a rifle since basic training, which in Lakis's case was almost 10 years ago. Not that he had one to fire until he acquired it from a wounded man after they came under air attack and naval gunfire. Nor did the second lieutenant star on his epaulette mean he was qualified to command frontline infantry. It was there because as a lawyer he was part of the National Guard's legal department.\nBut his men didn't know that, and when I met him in the foothills of the Kyrenia range, where the dry earth was being blown into big brown clouds by Turkish artillery, they appeared willing to follow him almost anywhere. Some still do. In May, when the heat was kinder, several of them joined their lieutenant in the search for his bag, though he complained they weren't all as nimble on those rocky terraces as they should be.\nMilitary historian Colin Smith was the Observer's chief roving reporter in 1974.

The island was in an ideal location between many of the Eastern and Western empires. As a result, the island was part of many great ancient civilizations including Ancient Egypt, Persia, Ancient Greece, and the Roman Empire throughout its history. Starting in 364 AD, Cyprus was ruled for 800 years by the Byzantium Empire.\nBeginning in the 12th century, the island changed hands several times until it came under control of the Ottoman Empire in the 1500s. In 1878 Great Britain took over the island and made it an official British colony in 1925. In\n1960 Cyprus gained its independence from Great Britain. However different factions in the country could not get along. Starting in 1974, Cyprus has been divided into two sections. One side is controlled by the government and the other by Turkish Cypriots. Greek is spoken in the south and Turkish in the north. There is a buffer zone between the two sides where the United Nations keeps a peacekeeping force. Despite this odd situation, the island of Cyprus became a member of the European Union in 2004.\nThe Geography of Cyprus\nTotal Size: 9,250 square km\nSize Comparison: about 0.6 times the size of Connecticut\nGeographical Coordinates: 35 00 N, 33 00 E\nWorld Region or Continent: Middle East\nGeneral Terrain: central plain with mountains to north and south; scattered but significant plains along southern coast\nGeographical Low Point: Mediterranean Sea 0 m\nGeographical High Point: Mount Olympus 1,951 m\nClimate: temperate; Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and cool winters\nMajor cities: NICOSIA (capital) 240,000 (2009), Limassol\nThe People of Cyprus\nType of Government: republic\nLanguages Spoken: Greek, Turkish, English\nIndependence: 16 August 1960 (from UK); note - Turkish Cypriots proclaimed self-rule on 13 February 1975 and independence in 1983, but these proclamations are only recognized by Turkey\nNational Holiday: Independence Day, 1 October (1960); note - Turkish Cypriots celebrate 15 November (1983) as Independence Day\nNationality: Cypriot(s)\nReligions: Greek Orthodox 78%, Muslim 18%, Maronite, Armenian Apostolic, and other 4%\nNational Symbol: Cypriot mouflon (wild sheep); white dove\nNational Anthem or Song: Ymnos eis tin Eleftherian (Hymn to Liberty)\nEconomy of Cyprus\nMajor Industries: tourism, food and beverage processing, cement and gypsum production, ship repair and refurbishment, textiles, light chemicals, metal products, wood, paper, stone, and clay products\nAgricultural Products: citrus, vegetables, barley, grapes, olives, vegetables; poultry, pork, lamb; dairy, cheese\nNatural Resources: copper, pyrites, asbestos, gypsum, timber, salt, marble, clay earth pigment\nMajor Exports: Republic of Cyprus: citrus, potatoes, pharmaceuticals, cement, clothing and cigarettes; north Cyprus: citrus, potatoes, textiles\nMajor Imports: Republic of Cyprus: consumer goods, petroleum and lubricants, intermediate goods, machinery, transport equipment; north Cyprus: vehicles, fuel, cigarettes, food, minerals, chemicals, machinery\nCurrency: Republic of Cyprus: Cypriot pound (CYP); Turkish Cypriot area: Turkish New lira (YTL)\nNational GDP: $23,720,000,000\n** Source for population (2012 est.) and GDP (2011 est.) is CIA World Factbook.\nBack to Geography Home Page"

    "content": "Basic Facts on Cyprus for Travelers\nCyprus is sometimes spelled Kipros, Kypros, and similar variations.\nWhere is Cyprus?\nCyprus is a large island located in the Eastern Aegean area of the Mediterranean. The coordinates of the capital of Nicosia are 35:09:00N 33:16:59E.\n \nWhere is Cyprus?\nIt is located south of Turkey and west of Syria and Lebanon, and northwest of Israel. Its strategic location and relative neutrality in relation to many of the Middle Eastern nations has made it something of a crossroads and it has been helpful in some delicate diplomatic proceedings.\nCyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean, after Sardinia and Sicily, and ahead of Crete.\nWhat kind of government does Cyprus have?\nCyprus is a divided island with the northern portion under Turkish control. This is called \"The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\" but is only recognized as legitimate by Turkey itself. Supporters of the Republic of Cyprus may refer to the northern portion as \"Occupied Cyprus\".\ncontinue reading below our video\nBest Road Trip Apps\nThe southern portion is an independent republic called the Republic of Cyprus, sometimes referred to as \"Greek Cyprus\" though this is misleading. It is culturally Greek but is not part of Greece. The entire island and the Republic of Cyprus is part of the European Union, though this does not quite apply to the northern portion of the island under Turkish control. To understand this situation, the official European Union page on Cyprus explains the details.\nWhat is the Capital of Cyprus?\nNicosia is the capital; it is divided by \"The Green Line\" into two parts, similar to the way Berlin was once divided. Access between the two parts of Cyprus has often been restricted but in recent years has been generally problem-free.\nMany visitors go to Larnaca (Larnaka), the major port located on the southeast coast of the island.\n \nIsn't Cyprus part of Greece?\nCyprus has extensive cultural ties with Greece, but is not under Greek control. It was a British colony from 1925 until 1960. Prior to that, it was under British administrative control from 1878 and under Ottoman Empire control for most of the preceding several hundred years.\nWhile the Greece financial crisis affects the entire region and the rest of Europe, it is not impacting Cyprus much more than any other nation or area. Cypriot banks do have some ties with Greece, and the banks are watching the situation very carefully, but the rest of the economy of Cyprus is separate from that of Greece. If Greece ends up leaving the Euro, that will not affect Cyprus, which will continue to use the Euro. Cyprus has its own financial problems, however, and may need a separate \"bail-out\" at some point.\n \nWhat are the Major Cities of Cyprus?\nNicosia (Capital)\nKyrenia (Northern Cyprus). More information on Northern Cyprus .\nWhat Money Do They Use in Cyprus?\nSince January 1st, 2008, Cyprus has adopted the Euro as its official currency. In practice, many merchants take a wide variety of foreign currency. The Cyprus Pound was gradually phased out over the following few years. Northern Cyprus still uses the New Turkish Lira as its official currency. You can check the conversion rates using one of these currency converters .\nWhile Northern Cyprus will continue to officially use the Turkish lira, in practice its merchants and hoteliers have been accepting a wide variety of foreign currency for years, and this will continue.\nStarting January 1st, 2008, the Euro will be used in all transactions in Cyprus.\nHave old Cyprus pounds sitting in a drawer? Now is the best time to convert them.\nThe permanent conversion rate for one Cyprus pound into Euros is 0,585274 to one Euro."

T. Barnum, you say? Pretty close, but no. Although nearly always attributed to Barnum, the aphorism about suckers was actually delivered by Barnum’s rival David Hannum, a grade-A sucker himself. You see, in the 1860s, tobacconist John Hull created an elaborate, money-making hoax in which he had a 10-foot-tall stone statue of a man carved and then buried in Cardiff, New York. The giant stone man was then dug up again and Hull was now able to sell it as an archaeological oddity. In 1869, Hannum and four business partners took the bait and paid $37,500 for the worthless artifact thinking that they could turn a profit by charging people to get a glimpse of it.\nA lot of buzz was generated about the giant (was he a petrified biblical figure? an ancient Native American statue? a distant ancestor of Bill Walton?), and as thousands of people began to pay good money to get a gander, it looked like Hannum’s investment was going to pay off quite nicely. That is, until clever P. T. Barnum entered the picture.\nAlways the sly one, Barnum built a giant of his own and claimed that it was the true Cardiff Giant – a fake of a fake!  When people flocked to see Barnum’s creation, hapless Hannum (who didn’t even know at that point that he himself had paid roughly 40 grand for a fake) mused at the on-lookers, “There’s a sucker born every minute.”\nYou said it, Hannum.\nYet I eat 2 suckers every minute.  They’ve got to up their production if they are going to last.\nDoris Stones Edwards\nW.C. Fields said it first in a classic movie. Can’t remember the name of it.\nthe dark one\nlol, wc fields said it in a movie first, with movies being invented in the 1860 (talkies coming in the 20s) and wc fields being born the same year as movies invented.  Not even close…..\nDoris Stones Edwards\nSure enough, Wikipedia revealed that Fields had written and starred in a\n1941 film called “Never Give a Sucker an Even Break.” He had used the\nphrase several times before, first in a 1936 film called “Poppy,” and\nthen in 1939′s “You Can’t Cheat an Honest Man.”\ntoadaway\nBarnum was stealing Hannum’s show circa 1870.\nField’s first use, according to your own account, happened in 1936.\nHow does that make Field’s the first user?\nDoris Stones Edwards\nI’m done with this conversation, which started in 2006. I just stating some facts. Do an online Search, and answer your own question. I don’t have time for this. If I could delete my comment, I would and save myself the aggravation.\nthe dark two\nDoris, you are an idiot plain and simple.  I guess you believe everything you read on the internet….I have a bridge in Brooklyn for sale if you’re interested????\nDoris Stones Edwards\nDark Two,…you are DARK. No wonder you hide your picture! You’re the only cyber bully asshole that I’ve had to merely tolerate in two decades. You don’t even know how to have a decent conversation without getting derogatory? Well, in Rome,…Get a life IDIOT, and just let it go! Or, no doubt you’ll have to add what you believe is a brilliant and assuming comeback.

    "content": "There’s a Sucker Born Every Minute | Quote Investigator\nThere’s a Sucker Born Every Minute\nP.T. Barnum? Hungry Joe Lewis? Artemus Ward? Mike McDonald? Apocryphal? Anonymous?\nDear Quote Investigator: A famous saying about gullibility is usually attributed to the well-known showman P. T. Barnum. Here are two versions:\nThere’s a sucker born every minute.\nThere’s a fool born every minute.\nWhether Barnum actually used either of these expressions is controversial. Would you please examine this topic?\nQuote Investigator: QI has located no persuasive evidence that Phineas Taylor Barnum who died in 1891 spoke or wrote this saying. Researcher Ralph Keyes presented a skeptical stance with his assertion in “The Quote Verifier” that “No modern historian takes seriously the routine attribution of this slogan to P. T. Barnum.” 1\nThere exists a family of closely related expressions with a long history. Here is a sampling together with years of occurrence. The first item listed employed dialectical spelling. The word “flat” was a synonym for “fool”. The abbreviation “attrib” means that the words were attributed to an individual, but the evidence was indirect:\n1806: there vash von fool born every minute\n1826: a new fool is born every day\n1835: there is a flat born every minute\n1877: there is a fool born every hour\n1879: there’s a sucker born every minute (anonymous adage)\n1882: there was a sucker born every minute (attrib anon con man)\n1885: there was a sucker born every minute (attrib Hungry Joe)\n1888: there is a sucker born every minute (attrib Artemus Ward)\n1889: a sucker is born every minute (attrib Mike McDonald)\n1890: a fool was born every minute (attrib P.T. Barnum)\n1892: there was a sucker born every minute (attrib P.T. Barnum)\nThe above listing is a snapshot of current research results, and it will certainly change over time as more data is gathered. The earliest instances of these expressions were anonymous, and QI believes that later attributions had inadequate support.\nHere are selected citations in chronological order.\nIn 1806 an article titled “Essay on False Genius” was published in “The European Magazine and London Review”. Within the article an instance of the saying was attributed to a fictitious commodity seller. The passage reflected the prejudices and stereotypes of the milieu, and the phrase was written in dialect. Boldface has been added to excerpts: 2\nIt was the observation of one of the tribe of Levi, to whom some person had expressed his astonishment at his being able to sell his damaged and worthless commodities, “That there vash von fool born every minute.” And perhaps the calculation might be brought to the proof, that not more than fifty men of genius are born in half a century.\nIn 1826 “The New-York Evening Post” reprinted an article about a letter that appeared in a London newspaper and appended the following remark. A version of the adage using “day” instead of “minute” was placed between quotation marks and designated a “principle” indicating that it was already in circulation. No attribution was given: 3\nThe writer of this letter wonders that the English will continue to trade with America, and can account for it only on the principle that “a new fool is born every day.”\nIn 1835 “Bell’s Life In London and Sporting Chronicle” printed an instance of the saying that used the word “flat” instead of “fool” or “sucker”. The term “flat” in this article was applied to an individual who mistakenly entrusted money to a swindler for safekeeping: 4\nIt is only surprising, after the repeated exposures of this species of robbery, that fresh flats are so frequently picked up; but, as these ingenious speculators say, “there is a flat born every minute;” and it is not likely the race will become extinct.\nIn 1839 “Fraser’s Magazine for Town and Country” printed an instance of the saying that used the word “flat” in the domain was horse racing: 5\nMan may be fairly styled an animal of the class “gullible.” From the hour of his birth till the day of his death, never does the organ of credulity cease to bump out his cerebrum. It is a common saying among the legs of the turf, that “there is a flat born every minute.” No dictum can be based on better grounds.\nIn 1855 “The Yale Literary Magazine” published a comical poem about a baby show that mentioned P. T. Barnum and included word play with the terms “succor” and “sucker”. Note that a breast-feeding baby may be designated a “sucker”. Also, according to the Oxford English Dictionary the sense of “sucker” as a greenhorn or simpleton was already established by 1838: 6 7\nThey all were there in beauty so bright,\nArrayed in their very best bib and tucker:\nMr. Barnum provided for each one’s needs,\nAnd gave needed succor to each little sucker.\nThus, the poem stated that Barnum was attending to the needs of newly born suckers. Nevertheless, the earliest known evidence for the saying “sucker born every minute” was dated 1879, and the ascription to Barnum only occurred more than a decade later as detailed further below.\nIn 1877 a London newspaper quoted a “sharper”, i.e., a criminal trickster, using a version of the expression with “hour” instead of “minute’: 8\n“There is a fool born every hour,” said one of these sharpers to an informant of Mr. Anderson, the member for Glasgow, “and, thank Heaven, the majority of them live!”\nIn January 1879 the earliest instance using “sucker” appeared in an article titled “Gambling in Chicago” printed in “The Inter-Ocean” newspaper of Chicago, Illinois. The following words were attributed to an “old-timer”, and the saying was enclosed in single-quotation marks signaling that the phrase was already in circulation: 9\n. . . in the season they make a bit on base ball, or on the races, and then, you know, ‘there’s a sucker born every minute,’ and rigid city legislation drives the hard-up gambler, who would be a decent one of the kind, to turn skin-dealer and sure-thing player.\nIn January 1882 another instance using “sucker” appeared in an article titled “Keep Your Money: People Would Do Well to Look Carefully before They Leap” printed in a Chicago, Illinois newspaper: 10\nIt was an expert confidence man who said that “there was a sucker born every minute, and some have remained suckers all their lives.”\nIn 1883 other instances of the phrase with “sucker” appeared. For example, a newspaper in New Haven, Connecticut ascribed an extended version of the adage to archetypal gamblers: 11\nGamblers call all outside their fraternity suckers. They say “There is a sucker born every minute, and New York is the best place in the world to catch them.”\nIn 1885 a 41 page biographical sketch titled “The Life of Hungry Joe: King of the Bunco Men” was published, and the saying was ascribed to the notorious confidence man Joseph Lewis, aka Hungry Joe: 12\nIt was always a saying with Joe that there was a sucker born every minute, and all through his business career he acted on that basis, and generally found a good crop of them.\nIn October 1888 a New York newspaper described a jewelry-based swindle and the unfortunate souls who were deceived. The article ended with an instance of the saying ascribed to the popular humorist Artemus Ward, pen name of Charles Farrar Browne: 13\nOld men and young men bit alike and the experience, although dearly bought will, no doubt, be a lesson to them. Then, too, they can console themselves with that famous expression of Artemus Ward’s that “there is a sucker born every minute.”\nIn September 1889 a Rockford, Illinois newspaper printed the saying and credited a well-known Chicago criminal named Mike McDonald: 14\nThey have long since proved the truth of Mike McDonald’s celebrated maxim that a sucker is born every minute.”\nIn October 1890 a clothing store ran an advertisement in the “Chicago Tribune” that ascribed to P.T. Barnum a version of the adage with the word “fool”. This was the earliest linkage to Barnum found by QI: 15\nAny of these so-called Dry Goods stores go into the Clothing business by hiring a salesman from some clothing house, send him down to New York, and when he returns they “ADVERTISE” his purchases 40 per cent LESS than Clothing Store Prices. However, they don’t care a “—–” what they say in the papers, anything to get the crowd. Barnum said many years ago that a fool was born every minute.\nIn November 1891 the same clothing store ran another advertisement in the “Chicago Tribune” and credited Barnum with a slightly different phrasing that replaced “fool” with “new fool”: 16\nThe “Immortal” Barnum said every minute a new fool is born, and he catered that way and was successful. He could have kept successfully a “Department” Store.\nIn July 1892 a newspaper in Victoria, British Columbia reprinted a tale from a Montreal paper about a young Englishman who was swindled. The introduction presented an instance of the adage with the word “sucker”. This was the first linkage of Barnum to the “sucker” version of the maxim found by QI: 17\nThe appended sad story is clipped from the Montreal Herald of July 13, and, will be read with interest by Victorians: “The late P. T. Barnum, the king of showmen, often remarked that there was a sucker born every minute, and one of the slick gentlemen in Montreal evidently believes that it is true.”\nIn October 1892 the maxim was again ascribed to the defrauder Joseph Lewis, aka Hungry Joe, in the pages of a New York newspaper: 18\nWhen Inspector Williams was only a Captain, and the notorious bunco steerer “Hungry Joe” was in the zenith of his very questionable fame, the Captain, in a fit of laudable curiosity, asked the swindling expert how it was that he managed to live so well by his wits.\n“Why, don’t you know that there is a sucker born every minute?” Hungry Joe answered, in a tone of honest surprise that the Captain had not discovered the fact.\nSecondary and tertiary sources have associated the adage with George Hull, David Hannum, Joseph Bessimer, Adam Forepaugh and others. However, the data in this article is based directly on passages in newspapers and books with known dates.\nIn conclusion, the two expressions “there’s a fool born every minute” and “there’s a sucker born every minute” both had anonymous attributions initially. Over time they were reassigned to prominent individuals of the time period.\nHowever, only the fame of P.T. Barnum has endured. Today, the phrase “there’s a sucker born every minute” is often ascribed to him. Yet, support for this ascription is very weak. Citations occurred at the very end of his life and after his death.\n(Special thanks to PatriotFan whose query led QI to formulate this question and motivated QI to write up results primarily obtained in 2010. Great thanks to Bill Mullins who located the January 7, 1882 citation. Bill also found a valuable citation using flat in June 1835. Thanks to other ADS discussants. Also thanks to Barry Popik for his valuable research on this topic. In addition, thanks to the volunteer Wikipedia editors and jb5911 who clipped the 1879 citation with “sucker” at newspapers.com)\nUpdate History: On May 17, 2016 the citations dated February 22, 1835 and January 2, 1879 were added.\nNotes:\n2006, The Quote Verifier by Ralph Keyes, Quote Page 215, St Martin’s Griffin, New York.

    "content": "There's a Customer Born Every Minute: P.T. Barnum's Amazing 10 ''Rings of Power'' for Creating Fame, Fortune, and a Business Empire Today -- Guaranteed! by Joe Vitale, Hardcover | Barnes & Noble®\nSoundview Executive Book Summaries\nP.T. Barnum's Greatest Sales Approach On Earth\nIn addition to being one of the greatest showmen and businessmen ever, P.T. Barnum is author, copywriter and marketing expert Joe Vitale's mentor from beyond. Vitale therefore takes exception to the fact that most people only know of Barnum's management of the famous circus that still bears his name, and stresses that Barnum was involved with the famed circus only during the last years of his life. It was his American Museum (audaciously purchased with no cash down and a swampy island as collateral) — and his almost mythical promotion of General Tom Thumb (Charles S. Stratton) and Swedish songstress Jenny Lind — that made P.T. Barnum his money and fame.\nTell Your Story to Everyone Who Will Listen\nP.T. Barnum's observation that too many businesses hide their light under a bushel resonates profoundly with Vitale's experience as a marketer and copywriter. Barnum's simple and direct approach to communicating value to potential customers remains as true today as it did in his time. The master showman knew that if potential customers don't know what you have to offer, they aren't going to buy it.\nBeneath the gutsy tales of bold promotions, anecdotes about wild animals and crazy contests (or the story of how Barnum was nearly hanged) the book presents simple, applicable advice. Find a business you love, promote it like crazy then give paying customers more than they expect. According to Barnum (and Vitale), it's an approach that cannot fail.\nBarnum's 10 Rings of Power\nVitale also holds Barnum up as a man who understood the power of positive thinking decades before it was a pop psychology phenomenon. He was a man who endured tremendous personal and business tragedies (he went bankrupt twice), but had the attitude and strength of character to persevere and build immediately upon (at one point literally) the ashes of his defeat. Vitale draws out 10 points — or \"Rings of Power\" — that originate in the personal beliefs Barnum held on the subject of success in business. According to Vitale,\nBarnum's actions and writing attest that:\nHe believed there was a customer born every minute (not a sucker as the common saying would have us believe). Barnum went against the grain of our current \"targeting\" approaches, believing that the more people who know about your offer, the larger the pool of potential customers.\nHe believed in using skyrockets. He was the king of dreaming up audacious ways to grab attention, and in doing so invented the baby contest and the beauty contest.\nHe believed in giving people more than their money's worth. A quality as irresistible now as it was then.\nHe fearlessly believed in the power of printer's ink. Barnum understood the power of information. He believed that customers will listen to any story if it is sufficiently entertaining.\nHe believed in persistently advertising. Barnum understood that hit-and-miss advertising doesn't work, but a consistent message, told over and over, hits its mark.\nHe believed in helping people get results (what goes around comes around). Barnum was building strategic alliances with complementary businesses long before the term came into being.\nHe believed in negotiating creatively, treating employees and performers with respect. Fairness, respect and treating people as you would wish to be treated goes a long way now as it did in his time.\nHe believed all was well. He knew the energy expelled in being bitter over losses could be better channeled into overcoming adversity.\nHe believed in the power of the written word.\nHe believed in the power of speaking. Barnum knew that people pay attention to experts.\nSuccess in Life Is Everything\nPerhaps one of the most useful and memorable sections of the book is a reprint of The Art of Money Getting, penned by Barnum himself. In addition to containing the origins of the salient business practices echoed in Vitale's 10 Rings, Barnum's wonderfully homespun advice included warnings to not spend more than you make, not to drink or smoke, and to seek out simple pleasures.\nWhy We Like This Book\nSuccess stories are irresistible. So are unique characters. Vitale has given us plenty of both in this wonderfully personal, yet extremely relevant and applicable guide for anyone who wants to make their business the greatest show on earth.\nHis advice is also a life lesson, as pertinent today as when he first imparted it.

    "content": "The Story Behind “There’s A Sucker Born Every Minute” | Nosey Parker\nThe Story Behind “There’s A Sucker Born Every Minute”\nAlan Parker - April 6th, 2011\n“There’s a sucker born every minute” was the defining motto of 19th Century American showman and impresario P.T. Barnum.\nAlthough the words are often attributed to Barnum, they were actually said about him by a jealous rival, not by the great  man himself (according to Barnum, anyway).\nBarnum was the most flamboyant, outrageous, daring — and successful — of the many entrepreneurs who dazzled and delighted North American audiences throughout the 19th Century with shows of natural and unnatural wonders — the bigger and more bizarre the better.\nBarnum introduced awestruck Americans and Canadians to the 2-foot-5 dwarf performer General Tom Thumb (Barnum’s cousin), Nova Scotia giantess Anna Swan, the original “Siamese twins” Chang and Eng (from Siam — modern Thailand — of course), and a panoply of unusual humans  and exotic animals, including the original Jumbo elephant (who died in St. Thomas, Ont., after being struck by a circus train; Barnum had Jumbo’s skin stuffed and continued to exhibit it for years).\nBarnum also put up a breathtaking $200,000 to bring the world’s first superstar, Swedish Nightingale Jenny Lind, to North America for a tour that lasted years in the 1850s, making them both fabulously wealthy in the process.\nSo P.T. Barnum was always looking to put on a show that would entice audiences to part with their hard-earned cash. But he never considered his customers to be “suckers” and he gave them full value for the price of admission — usually.\nBut in the case of the Cardiff Giant, Barnum gave the paying customers what they wanted — even if it wasn’t real.\nIn fact, Barnum’s Cardiff Giant was a fake copy of an original fake.\nLet me explain.\nIt all started shortly after the end of the U.S. Civil War, when New York City tobacconist George Hull — a vocal atheist (not that uncommon for the time) — got into an argument with a fundamental creationist about whether or not the Bible could be believed when it said (Genesis 6:4) the Earth was once populated by a race of giants (sometimes interpreted as aliens).\nHull decided to stick it, so to speak, to the Biblical literalists by creating his own petrified Genesis giant; he spent a small fortune  and a good deal of time and effort doing so.\nFirst he had a 12-foot-long block of gypsum cut for him in Iowa and shipped to Chicago, where he promised to pay German tombstone carver Edwin Burkhardt handsomely to carve out a giant human form and keep his mouth shut. (According to Burkhardt’s descendants, the stonecarver died soon after completing his work and all Burkhardt’s widow ever got from Hull was $10.)\nHull and the sculptor then went to work on the stone giant with stains and acids to give it the appearance of great age. They even managed to create what looked like pores in the “skin” of the statue. The result was what Hull hoped his gullible religious opponents would take to be the petrified remains of one of the giants that once supposedly roamed the world.\nWhen finally satisfied with his handiwork in November 1868, Hull crated his monster and shipped it to the farm of his cousin, W.C. Newell, near Cardiff in upstate New York. The two men buried the stone statue deep in a field behind Newell’s barn and waited … and waited … and waited.\nFinally, almost a year later, the dug-up earth had settled and grown over enough that it seemed undisturbed ground and Hull launched his endgame.\nFarmer Newell — known as “Stub” to his friends and neighbours — hired two locals in October 1869 to dig a well behind his barn. Lo and behold, the two labourers made an incredible discovery — the petrified, preserved remains of an ancient human, soon to be known far and wide as the Cardiff Giant.\nAnd from far and wide gawkers soon came to witness this miraculous thing — and willingly paid 25 cents (50 cents within a few days — about $40 in today’s money) to Stubb Newell and George Hull for the privilege.\nExhibit tent on Newell’s Farm, 1869\nWith greed overtaking his philosophical pranksterism, Hull sold his two-thirds ownership share of the Giant for the whopping sum of $36,000 to a showbiz syndicate headed by banker and horse trader David Hannum.\nDavid Hannum, above, and the Cardiff Giant being shipped to Syracuse, below.\nHannum moved the Cardiff Giant up the road to the bustling city of Syracuse, N.Y., where it continued to draw such crowds that P.T. Barnum soon became interested  in acquiring the Giant for his museum of oddities down in New York City.\nBarnum offered $50,000 for the petrified man, but Hannum turned him down flat.\nBarnum, being ingeniously resourceful and unscrupulous, then bribed Hannum’s night watchman to secretly admit a craftsman in Barnum’s employ to make a wax model of the “real” Cardiff Giant.\nBack in New York City, Barnum had a plaster replica made of the wax model and put it on display, claiming that Hannum had sold him the “real” Giant and that the one Hannum was now showing in Syracuse was, in fact, a fake.\nWhat amazing gall.\nP.T. Barnum’s “fake” fake\nThis is the point at which Hannum lashed out at Barnum and the gullible masses flocking to see P.T.’s New York City “fake.”\nAnd it was a chortling Barnum who told the New York newspapers that it was Hannum who told him, “There’s a sucker born every minute.”\nHannum responded by suing Barnum for slander and loss of income for calling the Syracuse Giant a fake. Unfortunately for Hannum, the case was heard in a New York City court where Barnum was a generous contributor to the judge’s political campaigns.\nIt didn’t help that George Hull decided to pull the plug on his prank/fraud by admitting to a newspaper on Dec. 10, 1869, that he had faked the Cardiff Giant and set up the elaborate charade of its “discovery.”\nWhen Hannum’s civil suit came to trial on Feb. 2, 1870, both Hull and his cousin, Stub Newell, testified that the Cardiff Giant was a total fake, inspired by Hull’s anti-religious fervour and turned into a huge money-making event by the public’s thirst for new and strange sensations.\nThe judge promptly ruled that there was no slander in calling a fake a fake — even if Barnum was unaware the “original” was indeed a fake — and threw out Hannum’s suit.\nThe court case actually increased the public’s interest in  the Cardiff Giant and both Barnum and Hannum continued to display their two fakes for years and continued to make money, minute by minute,  from new generations of suckers, er, paying customers.\nHannum’s “original” fake Cardiff Giant was even an attraction at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, although it was overshadowed by things like the gaudy display of new-fangled electric lights powered from nearby Niagara Falls and by the assassination of President William McKinley at the expo site.\nIf you feel like paying the price of admission (sucker), you can still see both Hull/Hannum’s Cardiff Giant and P.T. Barnum’s replica. One’s at the Farmers’ Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y., and the other’s at Marvin’s Marvelous Mechanical Museum in Farmington Hills, Mich., near Detroit. I’m not telling you which is which.\n(Postscript: George Hull decided he was onto such a good thing that he created another buried giant — this time made of clay, ground bones, meat and plaster — that was “discovered” in Beulah, Colorado, in 1877. Hull and partner William Conant made a tidy profit from this new petrified giant, dubbed The Solid Muldoon since it was hidden on Muldoon Hill and there was a music-hall song, then currently popular, called “Muldoon, the Solid Man.” And, yes, P.T. Barnum’s fingerprints are attached to the Solid Muldoon: It’s likely he financed Hull’s latest enterprise and he was sniffing around Beulah within days of the “discovery” — but he seems to have decided there just wasn’t enough public interest to bring the Muldoon to New York City. Or perhaps the meat was just rotting too much.  The Solid Muldoon disappeared from public awareness shortly thereafter, as did George Hull. As far as I can tell, Hull avoided having his photo taken during his hucksterhood.)\nThe Solid Muldoon, R.I.P."

Barnum”\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_a_sucker_b …\nThere's a sucker born every minute\" is a phrase often credited to P.T. Barnum (1810 – 1891), an American showman. It is generally taken to mean that there are (and always will be) a lot of gullible people in the world.\nWhen Barnum's biographer tried to track down when Barnum had uttered this phrase, all of Barnum's friends and acquaintances told him it was out of character. Barnum's credo was more along the lines of \"there's a customer born every minute\" — he wanted to find ways to draw new customers in all the time because competition was fierce and people could become bored easily.[citation needed]\nWhile some sources claim the quote is most likely from famous con-man Joseph (\"Paper Collar Joe\") Bessimer,[1], other sources say it was actually uttered by David Hannum, spoken in reference to Barnum's part in the Cardiff Giant hoax. Hannum, who was exhibiting the \"original\" giant and had unsuccessfully sued Barnum for exhibiting a copy and claiming it was the original, was referring to the crowds continuing to pay to see Barnum's exhibit even after both it and the original had been proven to be fakes.\nIn turn, Barnum's fellow circus owner and arch-rival Adam Forepaugh attributed the quote to Barnum in a newspaper interview in an attempt to discredit him. However, Barnum never denied making the quote. It is said that he thanked Forepaugh for the free publicity he had given him.[citation needed]\nYet another source credits late 1860s Chicago \"bounty broker, saloon and gambling-house keeper, eminent politician, and dispenser of cheating privileges…\" Michael Cassius McDonald as the originator of the aphorism. According to the book Gem of the Prairie: Chicago Underworld (1940) by Herbert Asbury, when McDonald was equipping his gambling house known as The Store (at Clark and Monroe Streets in Chicago) his partner Harry Lawrence expressed concern over the large number of roulette wheels and faro tables being installed and their ability to get enough players to play the games. McDonald then allegedly said, \"Don't worry about that, there's a sucker born every minute"

    "content": "There’s a Sucker Born Every Minute | PUTTIN' COLOGNE ON THE RICKSHAW\nPUTTIN' COLOGNE ON THE RICKSHAW\nFebruary 22nd, 2015 by William\nThere’s a Sucker Born Every Minute\nThe phrase, “There’s a sucker born every minute” is often credited to Phineas Taylor (P. T.) Barnum (1810 – 1891), an American showman and businessman remembered for founding the Barnum & Bailey Circus. However, the phrase most likely came from a banker named David Hannum, who coined the phrase in criticism of P. T. Barnum’s typical customer. It simply means that many people are gullible and there’s no shortage of them. Fact is being gullible, or a sucker, is quite the norm in our society. That’s why scam artists abound and there are so many telemarketers and cyber-scams (like the Nigerian money transfer scam) that it’s a daily topic on the nightly news. This all is enabled by the fact that there’s no shortage of people who will fall for these scams.\nNone of us think we can ever be fooled, let alone fall for a scam, yet ironically the man (Hannum) who was critical of Barnum’s customers was in fact a sucker himself. As the story goes, back in the 1860s, tobacconist John Hull created an elaborate, money-making hoax in which he had a 10-foot-tall stone statue of a man carved and then buried in Cardiff, New York. The giant stone man (referred to as The Cardiff Giant) was then dug up again and Hull planned to sell it as an archaeological oddity. In 1869, Hannum and four business partners took the bait and paid $37,500 ($657,894 in today’s dollars) for the worthless artifact thinking that they could turn a profit by charging people to get a glimpse of it.\nA lot of buzz was generated about the giant, and as thousands of people began to pay good money to see it, it looked like Hannum’s investment was actually going to pay off quite nicely. That is, until P. T. Barnum entered the picture. Seems Barnum built a giant of his own and claimed that it was the true Cardiff Giant. When people flocked to see Barnum’s creation, hapless Hannum supposedly mused at the on-lookers, “There’s a sucker born every minute.”\nHannum was talking about the masses that are easily deceived and will “fall” for any lie. What Hannum and Barnum did was to perpetrate a grand lie. While lying is part of the fabric of our culture, in today’s workplace world, I’m not so sure it’s the most damaging behavior. I’m convinced that more people practice plain old bullshitting more than lying.\nWhy do I think the average worker partakes more in bullshitting than flat-out lying? First, understand that most people use these two terms interchangeably to describe the typical behavior they see and practice in the workplace. Let’s take a closer look at the art of bullshitting, how it compares to lying, and the effect it has on the workplace.\nDictionary.com defines a lie as: a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood; something intended or serving to convey a false impression; imposture; an inaccurate or false statement; the charge or accusation of lying. For Hannum and Barnum the false statement was that their statues were the real thing. In contrast, the definition of bullshit is: foolish, deceitful, or boastful language; something worthless, or insincere; insolent talk or behavior; to speak foolishly; to engage in idle conversation.\nIn the definition of lying, the word “false” appears numerous times, yet in the definition of bullshit, it doesn’t appear at all. Since a falsehood is defined as an untruth, a lie is therefore the telling of an untruth–just as both Hannum and Barnum did. On the other hand bullshitting is boastful, worthless, insincere language. There’s a big difference. Boastful, worthless, insincere language doesn’t necessarily equate to an untruth.\nHere’s a timely example. Everyone who utilizes the professional social media site LinkedIn probably has numerous “skills” and “endorsements” listed on their profile. Along with each skill there are a number of people who supposedly vouch that the person actually possesses that skill. None of those skills are necessarily untruths as we all gain a wide range of experience from what we’re exposed to during our careers. But with all these supposed skills it’s really a matter of degree. Remember one of the descriptors of bullshit is “boastful language” and that’s all those skill lists really are. If we wanted the list to reflect true skills that we’ve gained though our career we’d be listing such things as: “firefighting,” “sabotaging colleagues,” “ass-covering,” or “regurgitating buzzwords.” The list goes on.\nAn interesting infographic titled, “The Lies We Tell on Resumes,” details the not so surprising statistics on the pervasiveness of lying and bullshitting on resumes.

Barnum said, \"There's a sucker born every minute\" -- and that's especially true in Denver\nWednesday, September 29, 2010 at 6:43 a.m.\nPrint Article\n\"There's a sucker born every minute,\" P.T. Barnum supposedly said\nThat includes all those suckers who still believe the stories about how Barnum, the founder of the Greatest Show on Earth, which rolled into town yesterday, called Denver home over a century ago.\nThe Greatest Show on Earth was originally called P. T. Barnum's Grand Traveling Menagerie, Caravan and Circus, and survives today as the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, which will offer ten days of performances starting tomorrow -- and is already inspiring a PETA sideshow regarding the treatment of its elephants .\nBarnum, a world-famous showman, coined the terms \"Siamese Twins\" and \"Bearded Lady\" and invented the concepts of the three-ring circus and modern marketing. In one famous hoax, \"suckers\" handed over their hard-earned money for a glimpse of an African-American woman named Joice Heth, who Barnum claimed was the 161-year-old former nursemaid of George Washington. When ticket sales started to falter, Barnum changed the story, claiming that Heth (who was actually eighty) was a machine made of whale bone and leather. The exhibit's popularity soared once again.\nBarnum was also a wheeler-dealer, making money by buying up land and building hotels around the country. In 1871, he bought a 765-acre tract near what was then Denver, part of which is now the Barnum neighborhood. But Barnum was the sucker in that deal: Instead of the elegantly landscaped area he had been promised by the Chicago businessmen who sold him the land, it was a giant mud puddle. Barnum sold off some of it and turned the rest into Barnum Town, which Denver later annexed. And Barnum never lived on any of it, according to this 2001 Westword cover story , which took the show out of the showman.\nBut local legend still has Barnum housing his circus entourage, including his famed elephants, in Barnum Town -- and there's even a photo that allegedly shows an elephant pushing a circus train up Boreas Pass to Breckenridge.\nAs Barnum said -- or did he? -- there's a sucker born every minute.\nPatricia Calhoun co-founded Westword, Denver’s News and Arts weekly, in 1977; she’s been the editor there ever since. She’s a regular on the weekly Colorado Public Television roundtable Colorado Inside Out, the former president of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies -- a post that got her an unexpected interview with former President Bill Clinton in front of a thousand people (while she was in flip-flops) -- and played a real journalist in John Sayles’s Silver City.\nContact:"

I'm not doing an action movie,' \" he recounted in a 2015 interview with the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.\nIt ended up being one of the most memorably villainous roles in film history.\nIn the 2015 interview, Rickman recounted that he helped shape the role, despite being a novice film actor hired because he would work cheap.\nAfter being fitted to wear a militaristic outfit as leader of a band of terrorists, Rickman suggested that perhaps Gruber could wear a suit, affect an American accent and pretend to be a civilian trapped in the building for a scene with Willis' cop character.\nHe said he was told, \"You'll wear what you're told.\"\n\"But then I came back, and they handed me the new script\" that included the revisions.\n\"So you know, it just pays to occasionally use a little bit of theater training when you're doing a movie.\"\nJUST WATCHED\nMUST WATCH\n'Harry Potter' actor Alan Rickman dies 02:02\nDespite acclaim for his portrayal of Gruber and performances in movies such as \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,\" \"Truly Madly Deeply\" and \"Sense and Sensibility,\" Rickman was never nominated for an Oscar.\nHe did win a BAFTA Award for supporting actor in \"Robin Hood\" and was nominated three other times, including for \"Truly Madly Deeply,\" in 1990, and \"Sense and Sensibility\" in 1995.\nHe also won a Golden Globe in 1997 for best actor in the HBO biopic \"Rasputin.\"\nAlthough he carried on a lifelong love affair with stage acting, Rickman is probably best known to younger filmgoers as Snape, the antagonistic and bullying wizard who, in the end, plays a crucial role in the Potter saga.\nHe took the role in 2001's \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" without knowing much about the character.\n\"People thought I knew a lot, and I didn't,\" he said. \"When I was asked to do it, there were only three books written.\"\nPhotos: People we lost in 2016\nPhotos: People we lost in 2016\nHide Caption\n118 of 119\nPhotos: People we lost in 2016\nFormer U.S. Rep. Mike Oxley -- co-author of a landmark anti-corporate-fraud law that bears his name -- died on January 1. He was 71.\nHide Caption\n119 of 119\nBut he did have a clue, he said in a 2011 thank-you letter to Rowling at the conclusion of the film series, which saw stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint grow up on screen.\n\"Three children have become adults since a phone call with Jo Rowling, containing one small clue, persuaded me that there was more to Snape than an unchanging costume, and that even though only three of the books were out at that time, she held the entire massive but delicate narrative in the surest of hands.\"\nThat knowledge helped shape his portrayal of the character, he told the Los Angeles Times in 2011.\n\"It was a punctuation mark in my life every year, because I would be doing other things but always come back to that, and I was always aware of my place in the story even as others around me were not,\" Rickman told the newspaper.\nHis presence was invaluable, \"Potter\" producer David Heyman told the Los Angeles Times.\n\"He had a real understanding of the character, and now looking back, you can see there was always more going on there -- a look, an expression, a sentiment -- that hint at what is to come,\" Heyman said. \"The shadow that he casts in these films is a huge one, and the emotion he conveys is immeasurable.\"\nActing was 'an inevitability'\nRickman was born in 1946 to a working-class West London family. Despite an early interest in acting, he studied graphic design in college and owned a design business with friends after graduating.\nIn 1971, at the age of 25, he applied to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, one of the oldest acting schools in England.\n\"There was an inevitability about my being an actor since about the age of 7, but there were other roads that had to be traveled first,\" Biography.com quoted him as saying.\nIn 1978, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, followed by roles in British television and theater.\nIn 1985, he won the role of Le Vicomte de Valmont in the stage version of \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses,\" his first major villain -- and the breakthrough role for which he was nominated for a Tony Award in 1988.\nLater that year, he went to Hollywood to try his hand at film acting. Despite not knowing much about the film business, he was offered the \"Die Hard\" role immediately.\n\"I'd never made a film before, but I was extremely cheap,\" he said in the BAFTA interview.\nAnd despite almost rejecting \"Die Hard,\" he said, the progressive storyline won him over.\n\"Every single black character in that film is positive and highly intelligent,\" he said. \"So, 28 years ago, that's quite revolutionary, and quietly so.\"\nPlaying Gruber gave rise to the notion of Rickman as master of villainous roles, one at which he often bristled.\n\"I don't see them any of them as one word,\" Rickman said of his roles in 2011. \"It doesn't matter what I'm playing, it's not one word, and I think any actor would say the same.\"\nNot all of his roles were heavy or dark, of course. In 1999's campy \"Galaxy Quest,\" a heavily made-up Rickman played a classically trained actor named Sir Alexander Dane. In the movie, Dane was a washed-up science-fiction actor whose character had a trademark expression, \"by Grabthar's hammer!\"\nThe exclamation was trending Thursday on Twitter in tribute to Rickman.\n'A rare and unique human being'\nAs news of Rickman's death spread, so did the tributes.\n\"I'm very sad to hear about Alan today,\" \"Harry Potter\" star Emma Watson tweeted. \"I feel so lucky to have worked and spent time with such a special man and actor. I'll really miss our conversations.\"\nJason Isaacs, who played Lucius Malfoy in the \"Potter\" films, tweeted, \"Heartbreaking news about lovely Alan. Nobody else could be as hilarious, tragic, terrifying & truthful all at the same time.\"\nBritish actor Stephen Fry called the news of Rickman's death \"desperately sad.\"\n\"A man of such talent, wicked charm and stunning screen and stage presence,\" Fry wrote. \"He'll be sorely missed.\"\nThe director of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Edward Kemp, said the school would be \"much the poorer\" without the involvement of Rickman, who was vice chairman of its council.\n\"He was generous with his time, his insight, his money, his experience, not only to RADA students but to young actors and theatre makers across the spectrum,\" he said in a statement. \"He will be much missed.\"\nActress Emma Thompson, who appeared with Rickman in \"Judas Kiss,\" \"Love Actually,\" \"Sense and Sensibility\" and three of the Harry Potter films, issued a moving statement mourning his death, according to numerous media outlets.\n\"Alan was my friend and so this is hard to write because I have just kissed him goodbye,\" she wrote.\n\"What I remember most in this moment of painful leave-taking is his humour, intelligence, wisdom, and kindness,\" Thompson said in the statement. \"His capacity to fell you with a look or lift you with a word.\n\"He was, above all things, a rare and unique human being and we shall not see his like again,\" she said.\nRickman is survived by his wife, Rima Horton, whom he met when they were teenagers. The couple had no children.\nHis fans still have a few new things to look forward to.\nHis film \"Eye in the Sky,\" about drone warfare in Kenya, is set for March release. He also did voice work for the upcoming \"Alice Through the Looking Glass.\""

Buckle up!\nCredit: Alice Nerr / Shutterstock.com\nThe tallest waterfall in the world is Venezuela's Angel Falls, which plunges 3,212 feet (979 meters), according to the National Geographic Society. The falls descend over the edge of Auyán-Tepuí, which means Devil's Mountain, a flat-topped elevated area of land with sheer cliff sides located in Canaima National Park in the Bolivar State of Venezuela.\nAngel Falls is named after an American explorer and bush pilot, Jimmy Angel, who crashed his plane on Auyán-Tepuí in 1937. The waterfall is fed by the Churún River, which spills over the edge of the mountain, barely touching the cliff face. The height of the fall is so great that the stream of water  atomizes into a cloud of mist , then trickles back together at the bottom of the plunge and continues on through a cascading run of rapids.\nAngel Falls' total height, which is more than a half-mile (almost 1 kilometer), includes both the free-falling plunge and a stretch of steep rapids at its base. But even discounting these rapids, the falls' long uninterrupted drop of 2,648 feet (807 m) is still a record breaker and is around 15 times the height of North America's Niagara Falls, according to the World Waterfall Database, a website maintained by waterfall enthusiasts. [ See Stunning 360-Degree Views of Spectacular Victoria Falls (Video) ]\nHowever, Angel Falls is only the tallest waterfall on land. Technically, the largest known waterfall lies underwater, between Greenland and Iceland. The Denmark Strait cataract is more than three times the height of Angel Falls, dropping water a whopping 11,500 feet (3,505 m).\nNiagara Falls span the border between the United States and Canada. Though remarkably wide, Niagara is not the tallest or highest-volume waterfall in the world.\nCredit: Sayran  Dreamstime\nThe underwater waterfall is formed by the temperature difference between the water on each side of the Denmark Strait. When the colder, denser water from the east meets the warmer, lighter water from the west, the cold water flows down and underneath the warm water.\nThe Denmark Strait cataract is also the the top waterfall in terms of volume, carrying 175 million cubic feet (5.0 million cubic meters) of water. Back on land, pinpointing the largest waterfall is a little trickier because there is no universal standard for designating what counts as a waterfall, according to the World Waterfalls Database .\nSome waterfalls consist of a single, sheer drop; others include a gentler cascade over rapids; and still others involve a combination of the two (like Angel Falls).\nThe World Waterfalls Database lists Inga Falls, an area of rapids on the Congo River, as the waterfall with the largest volume. More than 11 million gallons (46 million liters) of water flow through Inga Falls each second. However, without a significant vertical drop, Inga Falls may not count as a waterfall under other classifications.\nOf waterfalls that do include a vertical drop, the waterfall with the greatest volume is the 45-foot-tall (14 meters) Khone Falls, on the border between Laos and Cambodia. Spilling 2.5 million gallons (9.5 million liters) of the Mekong River every second, Khone Falls' flow is nearly double the volume of Niagara Falls.\nThis article was first published on Aug. 10, 2010.

    "content": "Top 10 Tallest Waterfalls - based on cumulative height\n[Back to top]\nINTRODUCTION\nDue to numerous inquiries, we've decided to showcase the tallest waterfalls that we've personally visited in our travels.  One critical definition to make clear here is that \"tallest\" refers to the cumulative height of the waterfall.  We have a separate list for waterfalls with the tallest leap .\nI have to admit that I've been critical about any World's Tallest list because there's no consensus as to how waterfalls are defined (i.e. when a waterfall begins and ends, how long it must flow to count, etc.) and even fewer have been accurately measured (with the clinometer and rangefinder combo along with some trigonometry).  So it's extremely difficult to come up with a definitive list of tallest waterfalls.  Indeed, those lists that are already out there can easily be picked apart by someone who has actually been to the waterfalls that can make that judgement call or provide solid scientific evidence for their inclusion or exclusion.\nThat's why we're limiting this list to just the ones we've seen.  And as you can imagine, it's certainly not easy to put together this list even for the ones we have been to!  So we've relied on our judgment, estimates from the World Waterfall Database , and some local input.\nMoreover, to narrow down this list a bit more, we've added an additional criteria that the waterfall must flow reliably and with appreciable volume on average for at least 6 months out of the year, year after year.  Hopefully, this eliminates some of those seasonal waterfalls that some might say do not count as legitimate waterfalls worth giving special attention to.\nThe end result is our list in reverse order...\n10. SKRIKJOFOSSEN [Hordaland, Norway]\nFor a while, we had left this falls off the list because we bought into initial estimates that this falls was \"only\" 455m tall.  However, we brought it back on this list after combining the latest findings from the Norgeskart (formerly Norgesglasset) with our field observations.  For reasons we've described later on this page , we're going with a tentative height of 560m, which qualifies this mysterious waterfall on this list.\n3. RAMNEFJELLFOSSEN (UTIGARDSFOSSEN) [Stryn, Norway]\nThis towering waterfall falling from glaciers into the lake Lovatnet can easily be overlooked as another run-of-the-mill tall waterfall in Norway.  However, after finally gaining some traction in its height measurements thanks to added features to Norgeskart by Statens Kartverk, we can finally lend some credibility to the claims that it's 818m (2,685ft) tall.  I think a return trip here is in order to get better views, take our time, and come prepared with a clinometer/rangefinder combo to settle the science once and for all.  Aside from statistics, as you can see from the photo, it's certainly a feast for the eyes.\n2. BROWNE FALLS [Fiordland, New Zealand]\nThis long cascade draining Lake Browne and dropping into the Doubtful Sound has been the subject of many conversations regarding whether it's the tallest in New Zealand or not.  Well, based on examining the NZMapped GPS Topographic Map (which itself is derived from Land Information New Zealand data), it's conceivable that the falls tops off at the reported 836m (2,744ft) though there have been published brochures saying the falls is 619m (possibly the first 200m or so of its drop is sloping stream before making the steep cascade).  Now this waterfall blends in with many of the other cascades you might find in the Doubtful Sound so even identifying this guy is a challenge unless you knew exactly what you're looking for.\n1. ANGEL FALLS (SALTO ÁNGEL) [Canaima, Venezuela]\nSo far this waterfall has stood the test of time and debate as being the consensus tallest waterfall on earth!  Statistically speaking, it has a cumulative height of 979m (3,212ft).  It leaps off the Auyantepui, which itself is an isolated plateau collecting rain at its soggy, mysterious top, and thus the presence of this waterfall is a miracle and an oddity in and of itself!  If you're looking to gaze upon this world wonder, be aware that clouds frequently cover its top so patience and a little luck is needed to get the view you want.\n[Back to top]\nNow For Some Gory Details...\nFinally, we acknowledge that putting out a list like this opens the door for debate about which waterfalls belong and don't belong.  Again, it all depends on who you talk to and what his/her criteria is so we realize that there is no definitive list of world's tallest.  Anyways, just to answer some nagging concerns about some notable omissions (especially if you're wondering why we didn't religiously follow the World Waterfall Database list), let's get to it...\nFirst off, it looked like Statens Kartverk in Norway improved their online topographic map (was previously called Norgesglasset, but is now just Norgeskart ).  A key feature they added was to be able to plot out elevation profile, which now makes height estimations paired up with field observations that much more effective.\nSo given that, we took out Strupenfossen despite its reported height of 820m (2,690ft).  That's because we looked into Norgeskart and its drop of nearly 1000m runs over 2km with significantly smaller steep drops.  That seems to agree with our field observations in that there were about three much smaller drops and the rest were more or less hidden or just insignificant streams.\nDøntefossen , which was reported to be 700m (2,296ft), was also left off the list.  That's because a Norgesglasset inspection revealed that the waterfall profile was really more along the lines of 450m with maybe some additional height if you're counting streams with much less slope both above and below the main elevation loss.  It's interesting to note that our original estimate of 476m (600m contour line subtracted by 124m contour line) wasn't that far off of this latest estimate.\nSeerenbach Falls , which was measured to have a cumulative height of about 585m (1,919ft) was left out because we don't think it would pass the longevity test.  In other words, we don't think it has a long enough season to count amongst the major waterfalls in terms of height.\nOther waterfalls that were left off the list (namely the Hawaiian ones) were left off because most of them don't last long enough to be reliably seen.\nAnd again, if you're wondering why Tugela Falls isn't on here, it's because we didn't visit it yet (thereby disqualifying it from this list).  Besides, without seeing it in person, we can't make any field observations allowing us to at least have a chance at determining the waterfall's longevity and especially elevation profile to verify claims about its height.\nJust to throw a wrench into things, we re-examined the status of Skrikjofossen , which was said to be \"only\" 455m (1,493ft) tall.  However, upon closer inspection of the new and improved Norgeskart (formerly Norgesglasset) with the height profile feature, we saw that you can make a strong case for its overall height to be on the order of 560m.  Moreover, it can easily be as much as 600m or more (due to a little bit of ambiguity regarding the elevation loss in the \"skog\" or wooded area) as a result of indeed hidden cascades that should (or shouldn't count) as part of the overall drop.  I'm afraid that's really a judgement call since other waterfalls have been getting the benefit of the doubt regarding the inclusion of cascades in the vicinity of the main drop(s).  It'll have to be one of those cases where field measurements will apply the science needed to resolve these judgment calls and ambiguities.  So until that happens, we'll go with the tentative figure of 560m.\nRecently, we removed Catarata de Yumbilla from this list because we doubt it passes the more stringent longevity and volume test (i.e. 6 months of appreciable volume on average every year).\nAlso under this requirement, we removed other waterfalls like Sentinel Falls and Catarata de Chinata from consideration.\nAnother recent omission was Mardalsfossen .\nThat was because it no longer fulfills the 6-month longevity and volume criteria we've recently imposed.  This waterfall has been regulated and only allowed to flow ostensibly from June 20 to August 20 (i.e. the Summer tourist season).  Even though we were fortunate to see it flow in late June or early July of 2005, it can only be reliably seen for 2 months out of the year.\nNonetheless, when it does flow, it's still impressive as it's said to have a cumulative height at around 656m, and its tallest of its two leaps is roughly 297m (though some have reported its tallest leap is 358m but one needs to be careful about the middle cascades between the two main leaps).  Those figures would've put this waterfall on this list as well as the other Top 10 Tallest Waterfalls list we're maintaining.\nAn interesting case is Ramnefjellfossen or (Utigardsfossen).  I had previously left it off the list because I had expressed skepticism about its reported height of 818m (2,685ft).  Then, from re-examining Norgesglasset, we saw that its height profile definitely lent some credibility to the lofty 818m figure.  Combining this new finding with our field observation, we decided to bring it back to the list.  But its position won't be definitive until we apply the rangefinder/clinometer combo to put some science into this once and for all.\nFinally, after a trip to the Lauterbrunnen Valley in Switzerland , we noticed a handful of waterfalls tumbling from heights that are an appreciable fraction of the peaks surpassing 13,000ft (meaning these cascades from top to bottom could conceivably have fallen over 4,000ft or more).  These waterfalls seemed to have enough volume for them to be considered more than ephemeral waterfalls (i.e. they have nowhere near the volume of say Angel Falls, but probably have similar durations to say Ribbon Falls in Yosemite ).  Should these waterfalls count? Even though most of them don't seem to have names except maybe one stream that was signposted Mattenbach, if you were to count these waterfalls, should they supplant Angel Falls as the world's tallest?\nAt what point does this become a contest of seeing which topographic region has the highest drainages rather than the highest waterfalls (which totally depends on how you define them )?\nIndeed, it's cases like these that test our tendency to want to designate a list enshrining the so-called \"world's tallest waterfalls.\"  It's also a big reason why we've added an additional restriction that the falls must flow reliably and with appreciable volume for at least half the year every year.  Furthermore, it's one of the main reasons why I think most \"world's tallest waterfalls\" lists are mostly bogus even though we're presenting you with such a list on this page (and this only includes the waterfalls we've personally seen).\nIn any case, I'm sure there are other waterfalls that you could argue should belong on this list.  And as you can see from the blurb we've put at the end of the list, even we have mixed feelings about what belongs and what doesn't.  So we'll leave this topic up for debate, which you can get into by leaving a comment on the form below...\nIf you're curious about the tallest waterfalls we've been to based on the highest vertical drop, click here ."

    "content": "Hajj - ReligionFacts\nReligionFacts\nBowker, John (ed.)\nHajj\nHajj refers to a Muslim's pilgrimage to Mecca and is one of the five pillars of Islam. At least once in his or her lifetime, each Muslim is expected to undertake this pilgrimage the sacred city of Islam. This holy journey is called the hajj in Arabic. While a visit to Mecca is beneficial any time of the year, it must take place during the month of Dhu al-Hijja (the last month of the Islamic year) to fulfill the requirements of the hajj.\nAs with the sawm (fasting), exceptions are made for those who are physically or financially unable to fulfill this obligation, and one is actually commanded not to make the hajj if to do so would cause hardship for his or her family. However, those unable to go themselves may fulfill their obligation by sending someone in their stead.\nThe hajj is commanded in the Quran - \"And pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto God for mankind, for him who can find the way thither\" (3:97) - and its rites were established by Muhammad, but Muslim tradition dates it back to Adam and Abraham, who were instructed by angels in the performance of the rites. The hajj was one of the last public acts of worship performed by Muhammad before his death.\nIn part, the hajj commemorates the stories of Abraham, Hagar and Ishmael and it has been assigned various other meanings throughout the centuries. For many Muslims, one of the most meaningful aspects of the pilgrimage is the unifying effect of bringing together believers from all over the world to meet and worship together.\nUpon arrival at the boundary of Mecca (about six miles from the Ka'ba), pilgrims enter the state of ihram (purity) in which they will remain throughout the hajj. Males entering this pure state don the ihram garments - two white, seamless sheets wrapped around the body - and sandals. This aspect of the rite not only signifies the state of holiness the pilgrims have entered, but it serves to contribute to a sense of equality and unity by removing visual indicators of class, wealth and culture. Requirements for women are less stringent, but they usually dress in white with only faces and hands uncovered. While in the state of ihram, pilgrims must not cut their nails or hair, engage in sexual relations, argue, fight or hunt.\nWhen he or she enters the city of Mecca, the pilgrim first walks around the Ka'ba seven times (the tawaf, or circumambulation) while reciting the talbiya, then kisses or touches the Black Stone in the Ka'ba, prays twice towards the Station of Abraham and the Ka'ba and runs seven times between the small mountains of Safa and Marwa.\nThe second stage of the hajj takes place between the 8th and 12th days of Dhu al-Hijja, beginning with a sermon (khutba) at the mosque on the 7th day. On the eighth day and night, the pilgrim stays at Mina or Arafat. On the ninth day, the ritual of wuquf (\"standing\") takes place at the small hill of Jabal al-Rahma in Arafat. The pilgrim then returns to Muzdalifa, a small town within the Meccan boundaries, to stay the night.\nThe tenth day is Eid al-Adha (The Feast of Sacrifice), a major holiday observed by all Muslims. For those participating in the hajj, the day is spent in Mina, where the pilgrim sacrifices an animal to commemorate Abraham's sacrifice and throws seven small stones at each of three pillars on three consecutive days (the pillars represent sins and devils). The pilgrim then returns to Mecca, where he or she once again performs the tawaf (circumambulation of the Ka'ba). The head is then shaved or the hair is trimmed, which marks the end of the state of ihram.\nAbout 2 million Muslims complete the hajj each year. The government of Saudi Arabia has contributed significant resources to maintain the holy places and manage the crowd of pilgrims. Despite the large numbers seen in Mecca each year, only a small percentage of Muslims have fulfilled the duty. Those who have done so may add the title hajj or hajji to their names.\nWith such a vast number of people in one place at one time, failures of crowd control and other problems have sometimes led to disaster. Some of the recent tragedies associated with the hajj have included:\nOn July 31, 1987, Iranian pilgrims riot, causing the deaths of over 400 people.\nOn July 9, 1989, two bombs exploded, killing one pilgrim and wounding another 16. Saudi authorities beheaded 16 Kuwaiti Shiite Muslims for bombings after originally blaming Iranian terrorists.\nOn July 2, 1990, a stampede inside a pedestrian tunnel leading to Mecca led to the deaths of 1402 pilgrims.\nIn 1994, another stampede killed 270 pilgrims.\nOn February 1, 2004, 244 Muslim pilgrims were killed and another 244 injured in a stampede during the stoning of the devil ritual.\nPerceived failure to prevent these events, or to react appropriately to them, has led to strong criticism of the Saudi Arabian authorities by Muslims. It should be said that such events are common enough across all religious celebrations. In January 2005, for example, Indian Hindu rituals resulted in a stampede when worshippers outside a shrine learned that their relatives had been crushed after slipping on the coconut milk that had been exploded upon an altar as an offering to the god. We can also remember the funeral of Ayatollah Khomeini, when the frenzy of thousands of mourners reached a dangerous peak and the body fell out of the casket.\nThe other pillars of Islam are:\nDaily confession of faith (shahada)\nDaily ritual prayer (salat)"

    "content": "The Hajj: a Muslim's pilgrimage to Mecca\nTHE HAJJ: PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA\nOverview:\nOne of a Muslim's duties, as described in the Five Pillars of Islam , is to go on Hajj at least once during his or her lifetime. This is a pilgrimage to Makkah (Mecca) in Saudi Arabia. Approximately two million Muslims went in 1999, of which about one million were from Saudi Arabia, and 6,000 were from the U.S. 1 Council on American-Islamic Relations  estimated in 2006 that \"some 10,000 American Muslims go on Hajj each year.\" 7 The number of American pilgrims is increasing yearly. Followers of Islam who cannot go on a Hajj because of ill health or lack of money are excused from the obligation. If one assumes that Muslims go on Hajj a maximum of once during  their lifetime, that the number of Muslims in America are about 6.5 million, and  that the typical age span for pilgrims is 60 years, then fewer than 10% of  American Muslims take part in the pilgrimage.\nThe Council on Islamic Education states:\n\"The Hajj consists of several ceremonies, meant to symbolize the essential concepts of the Islamic faith, and to commemorate the trials of prophet Abraham and his family...Prophet Muhammad had said that a person who performs Hajj properly 'will return as a newly born baby [free of all sins].' The pilgrimage also enables Muslims from all around the world, of different colors,  languages, races, and ethnicities, to come together in a spirit of universal  brotherhood and sisterhood to worship the One God together.\" 2\nMany Islamic terms have multiple spellings when translated into English. We indicate alternative spellings below with (brackets).\nPreparation for the Hajj\nEach pilgrim first enters into ihram. This is a spiritual state of purity during which the person must not quarrel, commit any act of violence or engage in sexual activity. Men signify the state of ihram by bathing, and wearing two pieces of unsewn white cloth: \"one covers the body from waist to ankle and the other is thrown over the shoulder.\" 4 Women usually wear a simple white dress and \"a head covering, but not a veil.\" 4 \"The white garments are symbolic of human equality and unity before God, since all the pilgrims are dressed similarly.\" 2 The pilgrim will then repeat the Talbiyah (Talbeeyah) prayer. One English translation is:\n \"Here I am, O God, at Thy Command! Here I am at Thy Command! Thou art without associate; Here I am at Thy Command! Thine are praise and grace and dominion! Thou art without associate.\"\nThe pilgrim enters the Holy Mosque at Mecca, right foot first, and recites the prayer: \"In the name of Allah, may peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. Oh Allah, forgive me my sins and open to me the doors of Your mercy. I seek refuge in Allah the Almighty and in His Eminent Face and in His Eternal Dominion from the accursed Satan.\" The pilgrim performs the tawaf. This is a counter-clockwise procession which circles, \"the Ka'aba, the [cube-shaped] stone building Muslims believe was originally built by Abraham and his son Ishmael... It is a symbol of unity for Muslims because all prayers, wherever they are performed, are oriented in the direction of the Ka'aba.\" 4,6 \nThe pilgrim then performs the sa'i. He hurries seven times between two small hills near the Ka'aba, called Safa and Marwah. This commemorates the desperate search for water and food by Hagar, one of Abraham's wives.\nSponsored link:\nThe Hajj:\nThe Hajj formally begins on the eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah (Zul-Hijjah) - the 12th month of the Muslim lunar calendar. Dr. Monzur Ahmed writes:\n\"Islamic months begin at sunset on the day of visual sighting of the lunar crescent [following the new moon]... Although it is possible to calculate the position of the moon in the sky with high precision, it is often difficult to predict if a crescent will be visible from a particular location... Usually the moon has to be at least 15 hours old before it can be seen from somewhere on earth.\" 3\nOn this first day of the Hajj, the pilgrims walk a few miles to Mina and camp there overnight. This will occur about 2000-MAR-14. It falls on a date about 11 days earlier each year.\nThe pilgrims spend the \"Day of Arafah\" (ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah) in Arafah, an empty plain. They commit the entire day to supplication and devotion. In the evening, they move to Muzdalifa. They camp there overnight and offer various prayers.\nOn the tenth day of Dhul-Hijjah, they return to Mina and throw seven pebbles at a pillar that symbolizes Satan's temptation of Abraham. (The Qur'an describes how Satan tried to persuade Abraham to not ritually murder his son Ishmael, as commanded by God). The pilgrims then sacrifice a sheep, recalling how Abraham sacrificed a sheep that God had provided in place of his son. The meat is distributed to friends, relative and the poor. Afterwards, they return to Mecca and perform a final tawaf and sa'i. They symbolize the completion of the Hajj by cutting their hair.\nMuslims worldwide gather for communal prayers on the first day of Id al-Adha (Eid-ul-Adha) -- the Feast of Sacrifice or Day of Sacrifice. The first day of this celebration is held on the 10th day of Duhl-Hijja, the last month of the Muslim year. This is the second of the two major Muslim annual holidays. In most areas, this event is celebrated over several days.\nSponsored links:\nReferences:\nThe following information sources were used to prepare and update the above  essay.

    "content": "Pilgrimage (Hajj)\nPilgrimage\nPrevious Next\nPilgrimage (Hajj)\nHajj literally means, “to continuously strive to reach one’s goal.” The Hajj, or Pilgrimage to Mecca, is a once-in-a-lifetime obligation for those who have the physical and financial ability to undertake the journey.\nThe Hajj is essentially a re-enactment of the rituals of the great prophets and teachers of faith. Pilgrims symbolically relive the experience of exile and atonement undergone by Adam and Eve after they were expelled from Heaven, wandered the earth, met again and sought forgiveness in the valley of Mecca. They also retrace the frantic footsteps of the wife of Abraham, Hagar, as she ran between the hills of Safa and Marwa searching for water for her thirsty baby (which according to Muslim tradition, God answered with the well of Zam Zam). Lastly, the pilgrims also commemorate the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son for the sake of God. God later substituted a ram in place of his son.\nPerforming the rituals of Hajj provides a reminder of how the great prophets and teachers of faith established a deep and personal relationship with God. As the pilgrim makes his supplications to God, he realizes that He is asking of the same God that answered the prayers of those before him. These reminders are an important part of strengthening one’s faith, trust and dependence in God.\nThe faithful hope that the Hajj will bring about a deep spiritual transformation, one that will make him or her a better person. If such a change from within does not occur, then the Hajj was merely a physical and material exercise devoid of any spiritual significance. As all great religions teach, we are more than mere physical creatures in that we possess an essence beyond the material world. Indeed, this is why all great religions have a tradition of pilgrimage. In the Islamic tradition, Hajj encapsulates this spiritual journey toward this essence. Hajj teaches one to show sincerity and humilty in one’s relationship with God. The result of a successful Hajj is a rich inner peace, which is manifested outwardly in the values of justice, honesty, respect, generosity, kindness, forgiveness, mercy and empathy.\nThese are the articles and videos covered in this section:"

    "content": "The Significance of Mecca to Islam\nThe Significance of Mecca\nMecca is the original English translation of the Arabic.  Historically, the city has also been called Becca.\nIn the 1980s, the Saudi Arabian government, and others, began promoting the spelling Makkah (in full form, Makkah al-Mukarramah), which more closely resembles the actual Arabic pronunciation.\nAccording to Islamic tradition, the history of Mecca goes back to Abraham when he built the Ka'aba with the help of his son Ishmael around 2000 BC.\nAccording to other Islamic tradition, Abraham was to have rebuilt the Bait-ul-Allah (House of Allah), a building which had been originally constructed by Adam.  Today it is called the Ka'aba, a building in Mecca towards which all Muslims around the world face in prayer, five times each day.\nMuhammad was born in Mecca in 570, and thus Islam has been inextricably linked with Mecca ever since.\nMuhammad was born in a minor faction, the Hashemites, of the ruling Quraysh tribe.  Islamic tradition states that he began receiving divine revelations there in 610 AD, and began to preach monotheism against Meccan animism.   Animism is the belief that all life is produced by spiritual forces separate from matter, and natural phenomena and objects (rocks, trees, the wind, etc.) are alive, and have souls. See section \"Muhammad, Background & History.\nMecca was cleansed of all its idols, and all the cult images, in the Ka'aba when Muhammad conquered Mecca in 630 AD. He therefore, ended the Quraysh's tradition of idol-worship by smashing the statue of Hubal along with the other 360 idols (perhaps, one for each day of the year) at the Ka'aba, and re-dedicated the structure to ALLAH, the one God. His triumphant return to Mecca is depicted in the picture to the right.\nIt needs to be noted that Arabs had been making the pilgrimage to Mecca-to the enormous granite Ka'aba, the old shrine at the center of the city-for hundreds, possibly thousands of years, before Islam to pay tribute to these 360 gods represented inside the Ka'aba's walls.  Muhammad destroyed all but two - that of the Virgin Mary, and that of Christ.  However, even those representations would eventually be banned under Islam's subsequent prohibition of images.  This prohibition was not endorsed by the Prophet.\nControversies have exploded over images depicting the Prophet Muhammad, namely his depiction as a turbaned terrorist in one of a dozen cartoons by Danish artists. Muslims explicitly prohibit images of God, Muhammad, and other prophets. Islam prohibits the representation of the human figure in art.\nBut does the Qur'an actually ban representations of Muhammad, or others?  The answer is no. There is not a single verse in the Qur'an that explicitly prohibits images of Muhammad-or of ALLAH, or God, for that matter, or any other human figure.\nIn any event, up until that time, Mecca's most important god was the god Hubal (an idol god worshipped in Arabia), having been placed there by Muhammad's ruling Quraysh tribe.  Historians state that the Ka'aba became the repository of these 360 idols and tribal gods from all of Arabia's nomadic tribes, and Hubal was the most senior of these 360 god idols worshipped in the shrine.\nMuhammad declared Mecca as the holiest site in Islam, ordaining it as the center of Muslim pilgrimage, one of the faith's five pillars.   Despite his conquest, however, Muhammad chose to return to Medina, leaving behind Attab bin Usaid to govern the city.  Muhammad's other activities in Arabia led to the unification of the peninsula (using a combination of force and diplomacy), putting an end to the wars that had disrupted life in the city for so long\nIslamic history states that Zamzam Well was revealed to Hajar, the wife of Abraham and mother of Ishmael, around the year 2000 BC, when she was desperately seeking water for her infant son. See the section on Islamic history. The name of the well comes from the phrase Zomâ Zomâ, meaning \"stop flowing,\" a command repeated by Hajar during her attempt to contain the spring water.\nTop ^\nThe Ka'aba\nThe focal point of Mecca is the Ka'aba, the \"House of God\" believed by Muslims to have been built by Abraham and his son Ishmael, and which is covered in a gold-embroidered black fabric. The sole reason was to honor ALLAH, and its sole purpose is to worship ALLAH alone.  As Abraham raised the foundations of the shrine, together with Ishmael, they prayed: \"Our Lord, accept this from us. You are the Hearer, the Omniscient.\" (Quran, 2:127)\nInside The Ka'aba - A Virtual Tour\nA Pilgrim's Eye View from Inside The Mosque Overlooking The Ka'aba\nThe Ka'aba is 40' cube style building made of granite, and rests on a marble base.  Located in  the city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, it is the most sacred site in Islam. The building predates Islam, and, according to Islamic tradition, the first building at the site was built by Abraham.\nThe building has a mosque built around it, the Masjid al-Haram. All Muslims around the world face the direction of the Ka'aba during prayers, no matter where they are.\nIslamic tradition narrates that Abraham's subsequent visits to the Arabian region, after leaving Ishmael and Hagar (in the area that would later become the Islamic holy city of Mecca), were not only to visit Ishmael, but also to construct the first house of worship for God, the Kaaba — as per God's command.\n\"Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as ALLAH wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son, or a son does with his father). Abraham said, 'O Ishmael! ALLAH has given me an order.'  Ishmael said, 'Do what your Lord has ordered you to do.'  Abraham asked, 'Will you help me?'  Ishmael said, 'I will help you.'  Abraham said, 'ALLAH has ordered me to build a house here,' pointing to a small hill higher than the land surrounding it.' The Prophet added, 'Then they raised the foundations of the House';\" i.e., the Ka'ba.  (Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Prophets, Volume 4, Book 55, Number 583)\nTop ^\nThe Yearly Pilgrimage to Mecca\n\"Behold!  We gave the site, to Abraham, of the Sacred House (That is, the Ka'aba that he built), Saying:  'Associate not anything, in worship, with Me; and sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or stand up, or bow, or prostrate themselves (Therein in prayer).  And proclaim the Pilgrimage among men: they will come to thee on foot and mounted on every kind of camel, lean on account of journeys through deep and distant mountain highways.\" (Quran, 22:26-27)\nWith the traumatic event of Muhammad's death in 632, there was no succession plan for new leadership left by the Prophet.   There were two schools of thought as to who should lead the community:  one group adopted the belief that leadership should pass to the most qualified leader; another group adopted the belief that leadership should be through hereditary succession.  These two groups have been at odds with each other ever since that time. See section on Islam denominations .\nAnd, this is the background as to how Islam is considered to be one of the \"Abrahamic religions\" with Judaism and Christianity because of the forefather role Abraham plays in their history, and in their holy books, as these religions evolved out of Abraham's life, and experience with God.\nToday, there are well in excess of 3 billion followers of these Abrahamic religions, accounting for more than half of the world's population. The Islam religion has some 1+ billion adherents, and is the 2nd largest religion behind Christianity which is double that size.\nTop ^\nTHE RITE OF SA'I For HAJJ and Umrah\nThe Hajj is a pilgrimage to Mecca (the Arabic name is Makkah).  It is the largest annual pilgrimage in the world, and is the fifth pillar of Islam — an obligation that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by every able-bodied Muslim who can afford to do so.  The Umrah (meaning, \"to visit a populated place\") is a pilgrimage to Mecca performed by Muslims that can be undertaken at any time of the year.  The Umrah is not compulsory, but highly recommended.\nA rite of these pilgrimages involves the story of Hagar's repeated attempts to find water for her son by running between the hills of Safa and Marwa.  This has developed into a Muslim rite known as the sa'i.  During the two Muslim pilgrimages, pilgrims are required to walk between the two hills seven times in memory of Hagar's quest for water.\nThe rite symbolizes the celebration of motherhood in Islam, as well as leadership of the women.  To complete the rite, Muslims drink from the well of Zamzam. Muslims will often take back some of the water, regarding it as sacred, in memory of Hagar."

Muslims from all over the world will gather together for five days to pray as one community, celebrating their history and giving thanks for blessings. From the Masjid Al Haram complex to the hills of Mina, the rites include circling the Kaaba seven times and visiting sites of historical and religious importance.\nWhen is Hajj 2014?\nThis year's hajj is expected to fall on October 1-6 , though that date depends on the sighting of the moon, as Islam follows a lunar calendar. Hajj takes place annually on the eighth day of the month of Dhul Al-Hijjah in the Muslim calendar.

    "content": "Saudi Arabia: Hajj Pilgrimage - Chapter 4 - 2016 Yellow Book | Travelers' Health | CDC\nSaudi Arabia: Hajj Pilgrimage\nChristopher S. Bowron, Salahudin M. Maalim\nDESTINATION OVERVIEW\nThey will come to thee on foot and (mounted) on every kind of camel, lean on account of journeys through deep and distant mountain highways . . . (Quran 22:27)\nThe Hajj is the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and the largest mass gathering in the world. Every able-bodied adult Muslim who can afford to do so is required to make Hajj at least once in his or her lifetime. Hajj takes place from the 8th through the 12th days of Dhu al-Hijja, the last month of the Islamic year. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar, the timing of Hajj varies with respect to the Gregorian calendar (for example, it was October 1–6 in 2014 and September 20–25 in 2015).\nMore than 2 million Muslims from >183 countries make Hajj each year (approximately 2.8 million in 2010), >11,000 of whom travel from the United States.\nMost international pilgrims fly into Jeddah and take a bus to Mecca. By foot or by bus, the pilgrim then travels 8 km to the massive tent city of Mina, where most pilgrims are housed in air-conditioned tents.\nAt dawn on the 9th day of Dhu al-Hijja, pilgrims begin a 14.4-km walk to the plain of Arafat, passing Muzdalifah along the way ( Map 4-16 ). The route is littered with cool mist sprinklers to counteract the oppressive daytime temperatures, but the risk of heat-related illnesses during this part of the journey is high. Hajj ambulances and medical stations along the route are available for medical assistance. Hajj culminates on the Plain of Arafat, a few miles east of Mecca, where the Prophet Muhammad delivered his final sermon. Pilgrims spend the day in supplication, praying and reading the Quran; it is the pinnacle of most pilgrims’ spiritual lives. After sunset, pilgrims begin the 9-km walk back to Muzdalifah, where they sleep in the open air.\nAt sunrise on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijja, pilgrims collect small pebbles at Muzdalifah and carry them to Mina. This day’s ritual is called the Stoning of the Devil at Jamaraat. During this ritual, pilgrims throw 7 tiny pebbles (specifically, no larger than a chickpea) at each of 3 white pillars. The crowded conditions at this site pose potential hazards; multiple deadly stampedes occurred from 1994 to 2004. In 2004, after 251 pilgrims were killed and another 244 injured, the Saudi government replaced the round pillars with wide, elliptical columns to reduce crowd densities. However, after another stampede in 2006 that killed 380 pilgrims and injured 289, the single-tiered Jamaraat pedestrian bridge was demolished and replaced with a wider, multilevel bridge. Subsequently, no further incidents have occurred at Jamaraat.\nTraditionally after Jamaraat, pilgrims sacrifice an animal to symbolize the ram that Abraham sacrificed instead of his son. More recently, pilgrims are required to purchase a “sacrifice voucher” in Mecca and have this sacrifice performed by proxy. Centralized, licensed abattoirs perform the sacrifice on behalf of the pilgrim.\nAfter returning to Mecca, pilgrims go immediately to the Grand Mosque, which contains the Ka’aba, the most sacred site in Islam, and perform a tawaf, circling the Ka’aba 7 times counterclockwise. Because of the vast number of people (each floor of the 3-level mosque has a capacity of 750,000), a single tawaf can take hours. In addition to tawaf, pilgrims may perform sa’i, walking or running 7 times between the hills of Safa and Marwah and then drinking water from the Well of Zamzam. Previously performed in open air, this route is now enclosed by the Grand Mosque and can be traversed via air-conditioned tunnels, with separate sections for walkers, runners, and disabled pilgrims.\nAfter a final tawaf, pilgrims leave Mecca, ending Hajj. Although it is not required as part of Hajj, many pilgrims extend their trips to travel to Medina. In Medina, pilgrims visit the Mosque of the Prophet, which contains the tomb of Mohammed and is the second holiest site in Islam.\nMap 4-16. Hajj destination map\nHEALTH ISSUES\nImmunizations\nAll pilgrims should be up-to-date with routine immunizations. In addition, hepatitis A and B and typhoid vaccines are recommended. Although a requirement for polio vaccine does not include adult pilgrims from the United States, it is best to ensure full vaccination against polio before travel. Children up to 15 years of age must show proof of vaccination with quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine and polio vaccine. Children older than 15 years of age have the same vaccination requirements as adults.\nMeningococcal Vaccine\nBecause of the intensely crowded conditions of the Hajj and high carrier rates of Neisseria meningitidis among pilgrims, outbreaks of meningococcal disease have historically been a problem during Hajj. In the aftermath of outbreaks in 2000 and 2001 that affected 1,300 and 1,109 people, respectively, the Saudi Ministry of Health began requiring all pilgrims and local at-risk populations to receive the meningococcal vaccine. Hajj visas cannot be issued without proof of meningococcal vaccination. All adults and children >2 years of age must have received a single dose of quadrivalent A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine and must show proof of vaccination on a valid International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis. Children between 3 months and 2 years of age must show proof of vaccination with 2 doses of meningococcal A monovalent vaccine with a 3-month interval between the doses. Hajj pilgrims must have had the meningococcal vaccine ≤3 years and ≥10 days before arriving in Saudi Arabia.\nCurrent Hajj vaccination requirements are available from the following sources:\nSaudi Arabian Ministry of Health ( http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/Hajj/Pages/HealthRegulations.aspx )\nSaudi Arabian Embassy ( www.saudiembassy.net/services/hajj_requirements.aspx )\nRespiratory Infections\nRespiratory tract infections are common during Hajj; the most common cause of hospital admission is pneumonia. These risks underscore the need to follow the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ recommendations for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for pilgrims aged ≥65 years and for younger pilgrims with comorbidities. Seasonal influenza vaccine, including H1N1, is strongly recommended for all pilgrims. Behavioral interventions such as hand hygiene, wearing a face mask, cough etiquette, social distancing, and contact avoidance can be effective at mitigating respiratory illness among Hajj pilgrims. Pre-Hajj travel advice about common respiratory conditions should include a general assessment for respiratory fitness, necessary vaccinations, and prescription of adequate supplies of portable respiratory medications (prefer inhalers over nebulizers).\nThe crowded conditions during Hajj increase the probability of tuberculosis transmission. Pilgrims are advised to see their doctors if they develop signs of active tuberculosis: cough with sputum and blood at times, chest pains, weakness, weight loss, fever, and night sweats.\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The illness is caused by a novel coronavirus that is similar to the virus responsible for the 2003 global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Cases have been identified in and around the Arabian Peninsula, but cases have also been exported to other countries, including the United States. The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, myalgias, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia have also been reported. The severity of illness has ranged from mild to severe, and approximately 35% of reported cases have been fatal. The role of animal-to-human transmission is unclear, but the virus has been found in camels in this region. The diagnosis can be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed by PCR testing. More information is available in Chapter 3, MERS .\nOther Health and Safety Risks\nCommunicable Diseases\nDiarrheal disease is common during Hajj, and travelers should be educated on usual prevention measures and self-treatment. A pre-travel visit should include discussions about prevention, oral rehydration strategies, antimotility agents, and emergency antibiotic use for treatment of traveler’s diarrhea.\nChafing caused by long rituals of standing and walking in the heat can lead to fungal or bacterial skin infections. Clothing should be light, not restrictive, and changed often to maintain hygiene. Travelers should be advised to keep skin dry, use talcum powder, and be aware of any pain or soreness caused by garments. Any sores or blisters that develop should be disinfected and kept covered. Special attention should be paid to protect the feet, which are bare when inside the Grand Mosque.\nNasal ablution, called istinshaaq, is the practice of rinsing your nose with water before performing some rituals during the Hajj. Medical literature has identified rare cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by Naegleria fowleri. Even though no cases of Hajj-related PAM have been reported, nasal ablution is common during Hajj, and pilgrims are advised to use safe water to protect themselves from this potential risk. When in doubt, they should use bottled water. Boiling or filtering the water are other ways to decrease the risk of PAM.\nAt the end of Hajj, Muslim men must shave their heads. The use of unclean blades can transmit bloodborne pathogens, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. Licensed barbers are tested for these bloodborne pathogens and are required to use disposable, single-use blades. Unfortunately, unlicensed barbers continue to operate by the roadside, where they use nonsterile blades on multiple men. Male travelers should be advised to be shaved only at officially designated centers, which are clearly marked.\nNoncommunicable Diseases and Other Hazards\nHajj is arduous even for young, healthy pilgrims, and many Muslims wait until they are older before making Hajj. Pilgrims who are caught up in the spiritual experience of Hajj may forget to take their usual medications. Travelers with chronic medical conditions should undergo a functional assessment before leaving for Hajj. The medical provider should identify each traveler’s unique risks and tailor a plan on how to reduce them. The provider should make any adjustments to the usual medical regimen, ensure that the traveler has an adequate supply of medications, and educate the traveler about symptoms that should prompt urgent medical attention.\nHeat exhaustion and heatstroke are leading causes of death, particularly when Hajj occurs during the summer months. Pilgrims should stay hydrated, wear sunscreen, and seek shade when possible. Umbrellas are frequently used to provide portable sun protection. Travelers should be counseled on minimizing the risk of heat-related injuries as well as sun avoidance. Some rituals may also be performed at night to avoid daytime heat. Pilgrims can be reassured that night rituals have been advocated as legitimate by religious clerics.\nFire is a potential risk at Hajj. In 1997, open stoves set tents on fire, and the resulting blaze killed 343 pilgrims and injured >1,500. As a result, makeshift tents were replaced with permanent fiberglass structures; no pilgrim is allowed to set up his own tent or prepare his own food. Cooking in the tents is also prohibited.\nTrauma\nTrauma is a major cause of injury and death during Hajj. Pilgrims may walk long distances through or near dense traffic, and motor vehicle accidents are inevitable. The most feared trauma hazard, however, is stampede. In such dense crowds, little can be done to avoid or escape a stampede once it has begun, but the physical environment of the Hajj has been engineered specifically to minimize this risk. Past stampedes have often begun as minor incidents; the 2006 Hajj stampede, for example, began when some pilgrims tripped over fallen luggage, but it resulted in hundreds of injuries and deaths. Death usually results from asphyxiation or head trauma, and providing prompt treatment is next to impossible in large crowds.\nSpecial Health Considerations\nMenstruation\nWomen are not permitted to perform tawaf around the Ka’aba stone if they are menstruating. The remainder of the rituals may be performed during menstruation if the tawaf was performed before the menstrual period began. Thus, a female Hajj pilgrim who suspects that she may be menstruating during the Hajj may request hormonal suppression of menstrual bleeding.\nDiabetes Mellitus\nMuslims with diabetes planning to make Hajj should make a pre-Hajj travel clinic visit with enough advanced notice to carefully construct a diabetes management plan tailored to the health challenges of the Hajj. Diabetic patients should ensure adequate prescriptions for all medications, including syringes and needles. A diabetes emergency kit should include easily accessible carbohydrate sources to counter hypoglycemia, glucometer and test strips, urine ketone sticks to evaluate for ketoacidosis, a list of medications and care plans, and glucagon as indicated. Lastly, durable and protective footwear are necessary to avoid minor foot trauma that can lead to infections.\nEpilepsy\nBefore making Hajj, a pilgrim’s seizure disorder must be controlled on stable doses of medications. Before departure, Hajj travelers should ensure they have adequate supplies of routine medications, as well as a buccal or rectal formulation of antiseizure medications.\nSAUDI GOVERNMENT SAFETY MEASURES\nThe Saudi government has created a Ministry of Hajj that collaborates with the Ministry of Health to improve pilgrims’ experience, including mitigating health risks during Hajj. The hospitals and health centers in and around the holy sites are adequately staffed and equipped for the large gathering. The medical facilities offer high quality of care, and services are offered free to Hajj pilgrims.\nTo ensure efficient transport through the King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, the Saudi government has built a modern airport terminal solely dedicated to Hajj pilgrims. Furthermore, modern modes of transportation (light rail, 15,000 Hajj dedicated buses, and even high-speed rail lines) have been developed to safely transport pilgrims to the city of Mecca and other holy sites.\nTo mitigate the risk of heat exposure during this journey, the government provides complimentary water distributed from refrigerated trucks, more air conditioned sites (tents at Mina), large sun-blocking canopies, and thousands of fine mist sprinklers. To further protect themselves, travelers are urged to avoid the most densely crowded areas during Hajj. When the option exists, performance of rituals at nonpeak hours is encouraged. For example, most pilgrims prefer to perform the Stoning of the Devil at midday, but Saudi authorities have decreed that it may be performed anytime between sunrise and sunset or even by proxy, if the pilgrim cannot access the Jamaraat bridge.\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nAhmed QA, Arabi YM, Memish ZA.

    "content": "PILGRIMAGE\nVideo Introduction about Hajj\nThe fifth act of Islamic worship is the performing of the Hajj               or the pilgrimage to Mecca. A Muslim must perform this pilgrimage               at least once in his lifetime if economic and political conditions               are favourable. The focal point of this pilgrimage is the Ka'ba,               which was rebuilt by Prophet Abraham some 4,000 years ago. Today,               the Ka'ba stands in the middle of a large courtyard of Masjid al               Haram or the Sacred Mosque. The courtyard of Masjid al Haram contains,             besides Ka'ba, the Maqam a Ibrahim and the fountain of Zamzam.\nThe Hajj is performed during the Muslim month of Dhul Hijjah which               comes two months after the festival of Eid               al Fitr . The various               ceremonies of the Hajj include:\nEntering into the state of ihram by wearing only two seamless                       white sheets. This is done by the pilgrims when they reach                     certain designated places close to Mecca.\nSaying of talbiyah starting at the place where the ihram                   is worn. Talbiyah consists of saying aloud the following:\nHere                         we come, O God, here we come No partner have You, here we come\nIndeed,                         praise and blessings are Yours, and the Kingdom too No partner                     have You, here we come\nOn entering Mecca, the pilgrims perform the first tawaf                       which consists of going around the Ka'ba seven times in                 an anticlockwise direction.\nAfter completing the tawaf, the pilgrims perform the sa'                       yy which consists of running between the two little hills                 of Safa and Marwa located near the Ka'ba. These are the two hills                     where                       Hajirah ran in search of water when Prophet Abraham had                 to                     leave her there on Divine command.\nAfter performing the sa' yy, the pilgrims move to Mina,                     a plain located about four miles east of Mecca, and spend                 the night                       there.\nNext morning, the pilgrims leave for the Plain of Arafat                       located nine miles southeast of Mecca. They arrive there                 in the early afternoon, say the combined Zuhr and Asr Prayers                 and                     listen                       to a sermon given by the Imam. The pilgrims stay in the                 Plain of Arafat only till sunset. This is the same plain where                 the                     Prophet                       Muhammad delivered his farewell sermon.\nAfter sunset the pilgrims leave Arafat and come to a place                       called Muzdalifah. In the Holy Quran, this place is referred                     to as al Mash'ar al Haram, the Sacred Monument. On reaching                 Muzdalifah, the pilgrims say their combined Maghrib and Isha                 Prayers and                     spend                       the night there. In the morning, after saying the Fajr                 Prayer, the pilgrims return to Mina once again.\nThe pilgrims reach Mina on the tenth day of Dhul Hijjah.                       This is the busiest day of the pilgrimage. The first ceremony                     that is performed at Mina is the throwing of small stones                 or ramy al                       jimar. In this ceremony the pilgrims throw stones at three                     pillars in a symbolic act of striking the devil.\nThe tenth day of Dhul Hijjah is also the day when pilgrims                       sacrifice their animals. This day is also celebrated all                 over the Muslim world as the festive day of Eid al Adha.\nAfter performing the sacrifice the pilgrims have their                     heads shaved or their hair clipped. After this they emerge                 from the state                       of ihram by wearing their everyday clothes.\nClad in their everyday clothes the pilgrims perform another                       tawaf of the Ka'ba. This tawaf is called tawaf e ziarat.\nBefore the tenth day of Dhul Hijjah ends, the pilgrims                     perform another sa' yy between the hills of Safa and Marwa.\nAfter this the pilgrims return once again to Mina where                       they stay until the twelfth or thirteenth day of Dhul Hijjah.                     During these two or three days the pilgrims continue to perform                     the ceremony                       of ramy al jimar or throwing of stones.\nOn the afternoon of the twelfth Dhul Hijjah (or of the                     thirteenth) the pilgrims return to Mecca for the last ceremony                     of the pilgrimage.                       This ceremony consists of the farewell tawaf of the Ka'ba                 after which the entire pilgrimage is completed and the pilgrims                 are                     free to go wherever they wish.\nAlthough not part of the prescribed pilgrimage, many pilgrims               carry on to Medinah and visit Masjid al Nabvi or the Prophet's               Mosque. It was in the compound of this Mosque that Prophet Muhammad               was buried.\nWhile the Hajj may only be performed during the prescribed dates               of the month of Dhul Hijjah, a Lesser Pilgrimage called Umrah may               be made individually at any time during the year."

(Allahumma) Labbayka!\" (At your service, O Lord!) Packed in the plane were white, black, brown, red, and yellow people, blue eyes and blond hair, and my kinky red hair - all together, brothers! �All honoring the same God, all in turn giving equal honor to each other . . .\nThat is when I first began to reappraise the �white man�. It was when I first began to perceive that �white man�, as commonly used, means complexion only secondarily; primarily it described attitudes and actions. �In America, �white man� meant specific attitudes and actions toward the black man, and toward all other non-white men. �But in the Muslim world, I had seen that men with white complexions were more genuinely brotherly than anyone else had ever been. �That morning was the start of a radical alteration in my whole outlook about �white� men.\nThere were tens of thousands of pilgrims, from all over the world. �They were of all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to black-skinned Africans. �But we were all participating in the same ritual displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believe never could exist between the white and the non-white... �America needs to understand Islam, because this is the one religion that erases from its society the race problem. �Throughout my travels in the Muslim world, I have met, talked to, and even eaten with people who in America would have been considered white - but the �white� attitude was removed from their minds by the religion of Islam. �I have never before seen sincere and true brotherhood practiced by all colors together, irrespective of their color.\"\nThus the pilgrimage unites the Muslims of the world into one international fraternity. �More than two million persons perform the Hajj each year, and the rite serves as a unifying force in Islam by bringing followers of diverse backgrounds together in worship. �In some Muslim societies, once a believer has made the pilgrimage, he is often labeled with the title �hajji� ; this, however, is a cultural, rather than religious custom. �Finally, the Hajj is a manifestation of the belief in the unity of God - all the pilgrims worship and obey the commands of the One God.\nAt certain stations on the caravan routes to Mecca, or when the pilgrim passes the point nearest to those stations, the pilgrim enters the state of purity known as ihram. In this state, the certain �normal� actions of the day and night become impermissible for the pilgrims, such as covering the head, clipping the fingernails, and wearing normal clothing in regards to men. Males remove their clothing and don the garments specific to this state of ihram, two white seamless sheets that are wrapped around the body. �All this increases the reverence and sanctity of the pilgrimage, the city of Mecca, and month of Dhul-Hijjah. There are 5 stations, one on the coastal plains northwest of Mecca towards Egypt and one south towards Yemen, while three lie north or eastwards towards Medina, Iraq and Najd. �The simple garb signifies the equality of all humanity in God�s sight, and the removal of all worldly affections. �After entering the state of ihram, the pilgrim proceeds to Mecca and awaits the start of the Hajj. �On the 7th of Dhul-Hijjah the pilgrim is reminded of his duties, and the rituals commence on the 8th of the month. The pilgrim visits the holy places outside Mecca - Arafah, Muzdalifah, and Minaa - prays, sacrifices an animal in commemoration of Abraham�s sacrifice, throws pebbles at specific pillars at Minaa, and shortens or shaves his head. The rituals also involve walking seven times around the sacred sanctuary, or Kaaba, in Mecca, and ambulating, walking and running, seven times between the two small hills of Mt. Safaa and Mt. Marwah. �Discussing the historical or spiritual significance of each rite is beyond the scope of this introductory article.\nApart from Hajj, the \"minor pilgrimage\" or umrah is undertaken by Muslims during the rest of the year. �Performing the umrah does not fulfill the obligation of Hajj. �It is similar to the major and obligatory Islamic pilgrimage (hajj), and pilgrims have the choice of performing the umrah separately or in combination with the Hajj. �As in the Hajj, the pilgrim begins the umrah by assuming the state of ihram. �They enter Mecca and circle the sacred shrine of the Kaaba seven times. �He may then touch the Black Stone, if he can, pray behind the Maqam Ibrahim, drink the holy water of the Zamzam spring. �The ambulation between the hills of Safa and Marwah seven times and the shortening or shaving of the head complete the umrah."

    "content": "Fact or Fiction?: Archimedes Coined the Term \"Eureka!\" in the Bath - Scientific American\nScientific American\nFact or Fiction?: Archimedes Coined the Term \"Eureka!\" in the Bath\nThe famed mathematician made many important scientific contributions. Was this exclamation really one of them?\nBy David Biello on December 8, 2006\nCredit: COURTESY OF CHRIS RORRES\nAdvertisement |\nReport Ad\nLet's begin with the story: the local tyrant contracts the ancient Greek polymath Archimedes to detect fraud in the manufacture of a golden crown. Said tyrant, name of Hiero, suspects his goldsmith of leaving out some measure of gold and replacing it with silver in a wreath dedicated to the gods. Archimedes accepts the challenge and, during a subsequent trip to the public baths, realizes that the more his body sinks into the water, the more water is displaced--making the displaced water an exact measure of his volume. Because gold weighs more than silver, he reasons that a crown mixed with silver would have to be bulkier to reach the same weight as one composed only of gold; therefore it would displace more water than its pure gold counterpart. Realizing he has hit upon a solution, the young Greek math whiz leaps out of the bath and rushes home naked crying \"Eureka! Eureka!\" Or, translated: \"I've found it! I've found it!\"\nSeveral millennia later, the scientific world is replete with the exclamation, and many people have received inspiration in the shower. The mathematical conjectures of Henri Poincar¿, Einstein's theory of relativity, Newton getting dinged on the head with an apple and discovering gravity--all have been described as eureka moments. Edgar Allan Poe wrote a prose poem to science by that title and the prospectors of California's gold rush were so fond of the phrase that it crept into that state's motto. Even the American Association for the Advancement of Science calls its breaking scientific news site EurekAlert.\nToo bad, then, that Archimedes probably never uttered the phrase in that way.\nFirst and foremost, Archimedes himself never wrote about this episode, although he spent plenty of time detailing the laws of buoyancy and the lever (prompting him to reputedly pronounce: \"Give me a place to stand and I will move the earth\"), calculating the ratio of circles we know as pi, and starting along the path to the integral calculus that would not be invented for another 2,000 years, among other mathematical, engineering and physical feats.\nThe oldest authority for the naked-Archimedes eureka story is Vitruvius, a Roman writer, who included the tale in his introduction to his ninth book of architecture some time in the first century B.C. Because this was nearly 200 years after the event is presumed to have taken place, the story may have been improved in the telling. \"Vitruvius may have gotten it wrong,\" says Chris Rorres, a mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania and a self-described Archimedes \"groupie.\" \"The volumetric method works in theory so it sounds right but when you actually try it you find that the real world gets in the way.\"\nIn fact, Rorres is one of a long line of scientists, including Galileo, who have read the account and thought \"That can't be right.\" As Galileo showed in his tract La Bilancetta, or \"The Little Balance,\" a scientist of Archimedes' stature could have achieved a far more precise result using his own law of buoyancy and an accurate scale, something far more common in the ancient world than a very precise pycnometer, which is used to measure displacement. (The surface tension of water can render the volume of a light object like a wreath unmeasurable.) \"There may be some truth to it,\" Rorres adds. \"Archimedes did measure the volume of things but the eureka moment was maybe due to his original discovery [concerning buoyance], not to sitting in the bathtub and then running through the streets of Syracuse naked.\"\nMuch like Newton's apple, the exclamation persists because of the enduring power of the story: a golden crown, a life in the balance, a naked mathematician. Archimedes was a font of both mathematical insight and smart quotes as well as the hero of some really great stories. (One credits him with the invention of the death ray--actually an array of mirrors to focus sunlight--to set fire to an invading Roman fleet.) The suspect foundations of the eureka moment take nothing away from the word's ability to uniquely and concisely convey the flash of inspiration."

    "content": "Archimedes\nArchimedes\nArchimedes Thoughtful by Fetti (1620)\nWhen we think of the great scientists and mathematicians of the ancient world, who have contributed greatly to today's inventions and researches, who could forget Archimedes.\nIn the hearts and minds of scientists Archimedes occupies the same respectable position as Newton and Gauss. In his ancient Greek days he was known as the \"the wise one,\" \"the master\" and \"the great geometer\". His works such as the \"Death Ray\" gained him popularity and fame that lasts till this day.  He was one of the last great Greek mathematicians.\nBiography\nArchimedes was born in 287 B.C. in the port of Syracuse, Sicily in the colony of Magna Graecia. His father was Phidias, who was an astronomer about whom nothing is known. We derive this information about Archimedes from his work \"The Sand Reckoner\".\nIn those times, in the absence of paper or blackboards, Archimedes used dust, ashes or any other available surface to draw his geometric figures. He used to get so engrossed in his work that sometimes he forgot to eat. It is alleged that he drew figures on his body after bathing and applying olive oil. According to the Greek historian John Tzetzes, who was famous for his research on Byzantinne Greek era, Archimedes lived for 75 years.\nExcept for the period of his life where he attended school in Alexandria at Euclid's, Archimedes spent all his life at Syracuse. Ancient Greek biographer Plutarch, relates Archimedes to King Hiero II of Syracuse. He says Archimedes achieved so much fame because of his relation to King Hiero II and Gelon (son of King Hiero II). He was a close friend of Gelon and helped Hiero solve complex problem with extreme ease, utterly amazing his friend.\nArchimedes died in 212 B.C. during the Second Punic war, when Syracuse was captured by the Roman forces after a two year siege.\nAccording to Plutarch, Archimedes was researching a mathematical diagram, when a Roman soldier ordered him to meet General Marcus (who was engaged in the siege of Syracuse). But Archimedes declined saying that he had to finish his diagram. Furious, the Roman soldier killed Archimedes. General Marcus was angered by the death of Archimedes, because he didn't wish him any harm. Another popular theory regarding Archimedes' death is that he was killed while actually surrendering to the Romans.\nTomb of Archimedes\nThe tomb of Archimedes is famous for it depicts his famous diagram, a sphere in a cylinder of the exact height and diameter. Archimedes had earlier proved that the volume and surface area of the sphere would be two thirds that of the cylinder. In 75 B.C., 137 years after the death of Archimedes, it was Cicero who was responsible for giving respect and attention to Archimedes' tomb, which had been long neglected. Cicero had heard about the tomb of Archimedes, but it took him a long time to find it, as the local populace were unable to help. Ultimately he found it at the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, covered in bushes. He cleaned up the tomb and gave it its due respect.\nDiscoveries and Inventions\nArchimedes has many discoveries and inventions to his credit, but he considered his theoretical work as his main triumph. Along with his inventions in mathematics and geometry, he is also known for the weapons he created for King Hiero II to help protect Syracuse. He is credited with many inventions in the field of mathematics and physics such as \"Death ray\", \"Archimedes claw\", hydrostatics, calculus, etc.. Some of his discoveries are stated below:\nHydrostatics:\nToday when we get any idea, we often shout the word 'Eureka'. This famous word is originally attributed to Archimedes, for the invention of measuring the volume of an object with an irregular shape. Once when Hiero had ordered a gold crown, he suspected  that the crown was not made of pure gold but also silver. However, he could not prove this. He told Archimedes of his suspicion.\nOne day as Archimedes thoughts were revolving around the problem, he took a bath in his bathtub. He realized that the amount of water that overflowed the tub was proportional to the amount of his body that was submerged. At the realization he came shouting out of the bathtub \"Eureka, Eureka\" and ran out on to the streets of Syracuse completely naked.\nIn his work 'The Floating Bodies', this principle is known as the 'Archimedes Principle'. But the example of golden crown does not appear in any known works of Archimedes.\nPrinciple of levers:\nAlthough Archimedes did not invent the lever, he discovered the reasoning behind why it worked.  It is said that he remarked, \"Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth.\" Plutarch explained how Archimedes designed the  block and tackle pulley systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of leverage to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to shift. It is also said that Archimedes built the Syracusia ship, which was the largest vessel of its time and capable of transporting 600 passengers. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the Archimedes' screw was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. The screw was a machine with a revolving screw shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a low-lying body of water into irrigation canals.\nArchimedes' claw:\nArchimedes' claw was invented to defend the city of Syracuse. Known as the 'ship-shaker', it is shaped like a crane arm, from which a large metal hook was balanced. When the claw was dropped on an attacking ship, it would lift the ship by swinging the arm upwards and then sink the ship.\nDeath Ray:\nThere have bee n many doubts about Archimedes weapon of the death Ray. However in 2005  the Death Ray was proved and tested by a University class (MIT).  Using over one hundred mirrors,they made a dummy profile of ship with 5 inch thick wood which ignited after focusing all the mirrors to a specific point on the ship. this experiment was then carried out again on a real boat in the water with the help  of the 'mythbusters'.Thus proving Archimedes death ray as no longer a theory but a definitely possibility that this 'death ray' tactic was used against the roman ships in Syracuse.\nMathematics:\nMostly known as inventor of mechanical devices, we cannot ignore Archimedes' contribution to Mathematics.\nBeing unhappy with the existing one, Archimedes is known to have invented his own Greek number system, so that he could accommodate more of his invented numbers.\nAccording to some, the greatest invention of Archimedes is 'integral calculus'. Using this, he measured the section of areas surrounded by geometric figures. He broke the sections into a number of rectangles and then added the areas together. This principle is known as 'integration'. Also a part of the discovery of 'integral calculus' is 'differential calculus'. He calculated ways to approximate the slope of the tangent lines of his figures.\nIn the 'Measurement of Circle' Archimedes discovers the value of the square root of 3 as being more than 265/153 (approximately 1.732) and less than 1351/780 (approximately 1.7320512). The accurate value is rounded to 1.7320508076. He aquainted us with this principle without offering any explaination.\nIn 'The Quadrature of the Parabola', Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4/3 multiplied by the area of a triangle with equal base and height.\nIn 'The Sand Reckoner', he set out the impossible task of calculating the number of sand grains the universe could contain. He challenged that it was not impossible to do, even if sand grains were too large to be counted. His friend King Gelo thought this was hardly possible. To solve the problem of sand grains, Archimedes invented a system based around the myriad or uncountable in Greek. It also denoted 10,000 in the Greek number system. He fixed a number system using powers of myriads (100 million) and finally calculated the number of sand grains in the universe as 8x1063 .\nSites Referred:"

    "content": "The History of Archimedes\nPalimpsest Exhibition Digital Community Links\nArchimedes of Syracuse\nArchimedes was born in the city of Syracuse on the island of Sicily in 287 BC. He was the son of an astronomer and mathematician named Phidias. Aside from that, very little is known about the early life of Archimedes or his family. Some maintain that he belonged to the nobility of Syracuse, and that his family was in some way related to that of Hiero II, King of Syracuse.\nIn the third century BC, Syracuse was a hub of commerce, art and science. As a youth in Syracuse Archimedes developed his natural curiosity and penchant for problem solving. When he had learned as much as he could from his teachers, Archimedes traveled to Egypt in order to study in Alexandria. Founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BC, Alexandria had, by Archimedes' time, earned a reputation for great learning and scholarship.\nEuclid was one of the most well-known scholars who lived in Alexandria prior to Archimedes' arrival in the city. Euclid was a renowned mathematician, perhaps best remembered for collecting all of the existent Greek geometrical treatises and assembling them in a logical and systematic order in his book, “The Elements.” This compilation was fundamental to the study of geometry for over 2,000 years, and undoubtedly influenced the work of Archimedes.\nAfter his studies in Alexandria, Archimedes returned to Syracuse and pursued a life of thought and invention. Many apocryphal legends record how Archimedes endeared himself to King Hiero II, discovering solutions to problems that vexed the king.\nArchimedes' Screw\nOne such story recounts how a perplexed King Hiero was unable to empty rainwater from the hull of one of his ships. The King called upon Archimedes for assistance. Archimedes' solution was to create a machine consisting of a hollow tube containing a spiral that could be turned by a handle at one end. When the lower end of the tube was placed into the hull and the handle turned, water was carried up the tube and out of the boat. The Archimedes Screw is still used as a method of irrigation in developing countries.\nThe Puzzle of King Hiero's Crown\nThe \"Eureka\" Story\nRead the Story »\nKing Hiero had commissioned a new royal crown for which he provided solid gold to the goldsmith. When the crown arrived, King Hiero was suspicious that the goldsmith only used some of the gold, kept the rest for himself and added silver to make the crown the correct weight. Archimedes was asked to determine whether or not the crown was pure gold without harming it in the process. Archimedes was perplexed but found inspiration while taking a bath. He noticed that the full bath overflowed when he lowered himself into it, and suddenly realized that he could measure the crown's volume by the amount of water it displaced. He knew that since he could measure the crown's volume, all he had to do was discover its weight in order to calculate its density and hence its purity. Archimedes was so exuberant about his discovery that he ran down the streets of Syracuse naked shouting, “Eureka!” which meant “I've found it!” in Greek.\nArchimedes and the Defense of Syracuse\nDuring Archimedes' lifetime Sicily was a hotspot for both geological and political events. The volcanic Mount Etna loomed threateningly over the island, while on all sides the titanic Punic Wars raged between Rome and Carthage. Situated strategically between the two great powers, Sicily naturally became an object of contention. Self preservation demanded that the kings of Syracuse negotiate with the great powers, and as a result the small city-state often found itself allied with one against the other. Such was the case in 214 BC, when pro-Carthaginian factions within the city chose to side with Carthage against Rome. Shortly thereafter, legions of the Roman army sailed to Syracuse and laid siege to the city walls.\nKing Hiero II had anticipated such an eventuality. Before his death in 216 BC, Hiero set Archimedes to work, strengthening the walls of Syracuse and modifying its great stronghold, the Euryelos fortress. Archimedes also constructed war machines to defend Syracuse.\nWhen the Romans arrived under the command of the famed general Marcellus, Archimedes was prepared. The Roman historian Polybius relates that Archimedes now made such extensive preparations, both within the city and also to guard against an attack from the sea, that there would be no chance of the defenders being employed in meeting emergencies but that every move of the enemy could be replied to instantly by a counter move.…huge beams were suddenly projected at the [Roman] ships from the walls, which sank some of them with great weights plunging down from on high; others were seized at the prow by iron claws….drawn straight up into the air, and then plunged stern foremost into the depths…. with great destruction of the fighting men on board, who perished in the wrecks….in reality all the rest of the Syracusans were but a body for the designs of Archimedes, and his the one soul moving and managing everything; for all other weapons laid idle, and his alone were then employed by the city both in offense and defense.\nThe Death of Archimedes\nFor two years the genius of Archimedes repelled the Romans, enabling the city to survive the lengthy siege. Nevertheless, in 212 BC the forces of Marcellus prevailed and took the city. Marcellus had great respect for Archimedes, and immediately dispatched soldiers to retrieve his foe. Apparently, the great mathematician was unaware that his enemy had stormed the city, so deeply were his attentions focused on a mathematical problem. When a soldier demanded Archimedes accompany him to the quarters of Marcellus he simply refused, and continued his ruminations. The enraged soldier flew upon Archimedes, striking the 75 year-old eccentric dead. Marcellus was greatly distressed upon hearing the news of Archimedes' death, and ordered that he be buried with honors. Archimedes' tombstone was, as he had wished, engraved with an image of a sphere within a cylinder, after one of his geometrical treatises.\nArchimedes' Legacy\nDespite the many fantastic tales surrounding the life of Archimedes, we are most indebted to him for his mathematical treatises and the contributions he made to the understanding of fundamental physical phenomena. Through the medium of geometry, he was able to elucidate the principles for such basic devices as the pulley, the fulcrum and the lever – devices still utilized today. Archimedes is also credited with the discovery of the principle of buoyancy, or the power of a fluid to exert an upward force on a body placed in it. His further research into volume and density was fundamental to the development of theories of hydrostatics-the branch of physics dealing with liquids at rest.\nThe story of the survival of Archimedes' treatises down to our own time is intricate and complicated, and has been traced in extraordinary detail. But an essential point is this: it is through three manuscripts that we know the texts of Archimedes treatises in Greek. One was last heard of in 1311, a second was last heard of in the 1550s, and the third is The Archimedes Palimpsest, now at The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, and the subject of this website. Because this is just the start of a fascinating story."

When he accidentally discovered the answer to the problem given to him by the king of Syracuse, he jumped out of the bathtub in which he was sitting at that time and ran all the way to the palace shouting; \"Eureka, Eureka!\" which in Greek means \"I've got it, I've got it!\" - not realising that he was completely naked.

The scientist invented war machines that confounded and terrified the invaders and what should have been a fairly easy task took the Romans three years to accomplish. When the city finally fell, the Roman general Marcellus gave orders that Archimedes should be taken alive and treated with the utmost respect. A Roman soldier came upon the scientist bent over geometrical figures he had drawn in the sand. So absorbed was he in his thoughts he did not realise that an enemy soldier was standing there. Perhaps he did not even hear the soldier tell him to get up and follow him because when the man drew closer Archimedes without looking up said to him: \"Don't disturb my circles, fellow.\" This so enraged the soldier he drew his sword and slew him.

The son of Philip of Macedon, who was an excellent Army     General and organizer. His mother was Olympias, princess of Epirus.\nAt the age of 20, Alexander assembled     forces in Greek Cities in Corinth that recognised him as their     Leader. His Army mainly consisted of Macedonian soldiers and also     some Greeks. He then invaded the Persian Empire, but whilst he was     at war in Thrace, some Greek cities rebelled, which brought him back     South. Whereupon he captured the city of Thebes and demolished it as     a warning to other Greek cities of what would become of them if they     tried to resist his rule.\nIn 333 BC Alexander advanced south     from Cilicia into Syria, after defeating the Persians at the River     Granicus, he defeated Darius III at Issus. He then proceeded through     Phoenicia to Egypt, where they accepted him as their liberator from     Persian Rule.\nDetermined to rule the World, Alexander     pursued conquering north, through Syria and Mesopotamia and defeated     Darius at Gaugamela in 331 BC. After Darius fled he was then killed     by his own men. Now occupying Susa and Persepolis, Alexander was the     master of the Persian Empire. Still determined to conquer the World     he continued through what is now Afghanistan to the Indus River     Valley and reach Punjab in 326BC. Averse to his will, but convinced     by his men that they had reached the end of the world, Alexander     turned back.\nAfter his death     his Empire soon dissolved, he conquered much of what was then the     civilized world. Alexander was governed by divine ambition to     conquer the world and create a universal world monarchy. He was the     first great conqueror who reached Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, and     Asia. He is famous for having created ethnic fusion between the     Macedonians and the Persians. Forming many Greek cities in Syria,     Iran, Bactria and in Egypt, the city called Alexandria. From many     victorious battles, Alexander created empire which had marked     history as the beginning of the Hellenistic Age and brought him     eternal glory.\n \nArchimedes\n \nWhen we think of the great scientists and mathematicians of the     ancient world, who have contributed greatly to today's inventions     and researches, who could forget Archimedes.\nIn the hearts and minds of scientists Archimedes occupies the same     respectable position as Newton and Gauss.

When the claw was dropped on an attacking ship, it would lift the ship by swinging the arm upwards and then sink the ship.\nDeath Ray:\nThere have bee n many doubts about Archimedes weapon of the death Ray. However in 2005 the Death Ray was proved and tested by a University class (MIT). Using over one hundred mirrors,they made a dummy profile of ship with 5 inch thick wood which ignited after focusing all the mirrors to a specific point on the ship. this experiment was then carried out again on a real boat in the water with the help of the 'mythbusters'.Thus proving Archimedes death ray as no longer a theory but a definitely possibility that this 'death ray' tactic was used against the roman ships in Syracuse.\nMathematics:\nMostly known as inventor of mechanical devices, we cannot ignore Archimedes' contribution to Mathematics.\nBeing unhappy with the existing one, Archimedes is known to have invented his own Greek number system, so that he could accommodate more of his invented numbers.\nAccording to some, the greatest invention of Archimedes is 'integral calculus'. Using this, he measured the section of areas surrounded by geometric figures. He broke the sections into a number of rectangles and then added the areas together. This principle is known as 'integration'. Also a part of the discovery of 'integral calculus' is 'differential calculus'. He calculated ways to approximate the slope of the tangent lines of his figures.\nIn the 'Measurement of Circle' Archimedes discovers the value of the square root of 3 as being more than 265/153 (approximately 1.732) and less than 1351/780 (approximately 1.7320512). The accurate value is rounded to 1.7320508076. He aquainted us with this principle without offering any explaination.\nIn 'The Quadrature of the Parabola', Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4/3 multiplied by the area of a triangle with equal base and height.\nIn 'The Sand Reckoner', he set out the impossible task of calculating the number of sand grains the universe could contain. He challenged that it was not impossible to do, even if sand grains were too large to be counted. His friend King Gelo thought this was hardly possible. To solve the problem of sand grains, Archimedes invented a system based around the myriad or uncountable in Greek. It also denoted 10,000 in the Greek number system. He fixed a number system using powers of myriads (100 million) and finally calculated the number of sand grains in the universe as 8x1063 .\nSites Referred:\nOlympics\nThe Greeks invented athletic contests and held them in honour of their gods. The Isthmos game were staged every two years at the Isthmos of Corinth. The Pythian games took place every four years near Delphi. The most famous games held at Olympia, South- West of Greece, which took place every four years. The ancient Olympics seem to have begun in the early 700 BC, in honour of Zeus. No women were allowed to watch the games and only Greek nationals could participate. One of the ancient wonders was a statue of Zeus at Olympia, made of gold and ivory by a Greek sculptor Pheidias. This was placed inside a Temple, although it was a towering 42 feet high.\nThe games at Olympia were greatly expanded from a one-day festival of athletics and wrestling to, in 472 BC, five days with many events. The order of the events is not precisely known, but the first day of the festival was devoted to sacrifices. On the Middle Day of the festival 100 oxen were sacrificed in honor of a God. Athletes also often prayed and made small sacrifices themselves..\nOn the second day, the foot-race, the main event of the games, took place in the stadium, an oblong area enclosed by sloping banks of earth.\nAt Olympia there were 4 different types of races; The first was stadion, the oldest event of the Games, where runners sprinted for 1 stade, the length of the stadium(192m). The other races were a 2-stade race (384 m.), and a long-distance run which ranged from 7 to 24 stades (1,344 m. to 4,608 m.).The fourth type of race involved runners wearing full amor, which was 2-4 stade race (384 m. to 768 m.), used to build up speed and stamina for military purposes.\nOn other days, wrestling, boxing, and the pancratium, a combination of the two, were held. In wrestling, the aim was to throw the opponent to the ground three times, on either his hip, back or shoulder. In ancient Greek wrestling biting and genital holds were illegal.\nBoxing became more and more brutal; at first the pugilists wound straps of soft leather over their fingers as a means of deadening the blows, but in later times hard leather, sometimes weighted with metal, was used. In the pancratium, the most rigorous of the sports, the contest continued until one or the other of the participants acknowledged defeat.\nHorse-racing, in which each entrant owned his horse, was confined to the wealthy but was nevertheless a popular attraction. The course was 6 laps of the track, with separate races for whereupon the rider would have no stirrups. It was only wealthy people that could pay for such training, equipment, and feed of both the rider and the horses. So whichever horse won it was not the rider who was awarded the Olive wreath but the owner. There were also Chariot races, that consisted of both 2-horse and 4-horse chariot races, with separate races for chariots drawn by foals. There was also a race was between carts drawn by a team of 2 mules, which was 12 laps of the stadium track.\nAfter the horse-racing came the pentathlon, a series of five events: sprinting, long-jumping, javelin-hurling, discus-throwing, and wrestling.\nThe ancient Greeks considered the rhythm and precision of an athlete throwing the discus as important as his strength.\nThe discus was a circle shaped stone, iron, bronze, or lead. There were different sizes according to age groups. The javelin was a long wooden stick shape with spear head, similar height to that of a person. In the middle was bound a thong for a hurler's fingers to grip and guide to the correct angle it was thrown.\nTo Jump long distances athletes used lead or stone weights to increase the length of the jump. These weights were known as 'halteres' were held in front of the athlete during his ascent, and then swung behind his back and dropped during his descent to help propel him.\nPosted by\nAncient Greek cloth\nAncient Greek clothing was typically homemade and the same piece of homespun fabric that was used as a type of garment, or blanket. From Greek vase paintings and sculptures, we can tell that the fabrics were intensely colored and usually decorated with intricate designs.\nClothing for women and men consisted of two main garments-a tunic (either a peoples or chiton) and a cloak (himation). The peoples was a large rectangle of heavy fabric, usually wool, folded over along the upper edge so that the over fold (apoptygma) would reach to the waist. It was placed around the body and fastened at the shoulders with a pin or brooch. There were armholes were on each side, and the open side of the garment was either left that way, or pinned or sewn to form a seam.\nThe chiton was made of a much lighter material, normally linen. It was a very long and very wide rectangle of fabric sewn up at the sides, pinned or sewn at the shoulders, and usually girded around the waist. Often the chiton was wide enough to allow for sleeves that were fastened along the upper arms with pins or buttons. Both the peoples and chiton were floor-length garments that were usually long enough to be pulled over the belt, creating a pouch known as a kolpos. Under either garment, a woman might have worn a soft band, known as a strophion, around the mid-section of the body.\nMen in ancient Greece customarily wore a chiton similar to the one worn by women, but knee-length or shorter. An exomis (a short chiton fastened on the left shoulder) was worn for exercise, horse riding, or hard labor. The himation (cloak) worn by both women and men was essentially a rectangular piece of heavy fabric, either woolen or linen. It was draped diagonally over one shoulder or symmetrically over both shoulders, like a stole.\nWomen sometimes wore an epiblema (shawl) over the peplos or chiton. Young men often wore a chlamys (short cloak) for riding. Greek men occasionally wore a broad-brimmed hat (petasos), and on rare occasions, Greek women donned a flat-brimmed one with a high peaked crown.\nFootwear\nWomen and men wore sandals, slippers, soft shoes, or boots, although at home they usually went barefoot.\nPosted by"

Archimedes had earlier proved that the volume and surface area of the sphere would be two thirds that of the cylinder. In 75 B.C., 137 years after the death of Archimedes, it was Cicero who was responsible for giving respect and attention to Archimedes’ tomb, which had been long neglected.

Along with his inventions in mathematics and geometry, he is also known for the weapons he created for King Hiero II to help protect Syracuse. He is credited with many inventions in the field of mathematics and physics such as “Death ray”, “Archimedes claw”, hydrostatics, calculus, etc.. Some of his discoveries are stated below:\nHydrostatics:\nToday when we get any idea, we often shout the word ‘Eureka’. This famous word is originally attributed to Archimedes, for the invention of measuring the volume of an object with an irregular shape. Once when Hiero had ordered a gold crown, he suspected that the crown was not made of pure gold but also silver. However, he could not prove this. He told Archimedes of his suspicion.\nOne day as Archimedes thoughts were revolving around the problem, he took a bath in his bathtub. He realized that the amount of water that overflowed the tub was proportional to the amount of his body that was submerged. At the realization he came shouting out of the bathtub “Eureka, Eureka” and ran out on to the streets of Syracuse completely naked.\nIn his work ‘The Floating Bodies’, this principle is known as the ‘Archimedes Principle’. But the example of golden crown does not appear in any known works of Archimedes.\nPrinciple of levers:\nAlthough Archimedes did not invent the lever, he discovered the reasoning behind why it worked. It is said that he remarked, “Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth.” Plutarch explained how Archimedes designed the block and tackle pulley systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of leverage to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to shift. It is also said that Archimedes built the Syracusia ship, which was the largest vessel of its time and capable of transporting 600 passengers. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the Archimedes’ screw was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. The screw was a machine with a revolving screw shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a low-lying body of water into irrigation canals.\nArchimedes’ claw:\nArchimedes’ claw was invented to defend the city of Syracuse. Known as the ‘ship-shaker’, it is shaped like a crane arm, from which a large metal hook was balanced. When the claw was dropped on an attacking ship, it would lift the ship by swinging the arm upwards and then sink the ship.\nDeath Ray:\nArchimedes Death Ray\nThere have bee n many doubts about Archimedes weapon of the death Ray. However in 2005 the Death Ray was proved and tested by a University class (MIT). Using over one hundred mirrors,they made a dummy profile of ship with 5 inch thick wood which ignited after focusing all the mirrors to a specific point on the ship. this experiment was then carried out again on a real boat in the water with the help of the ‘mythbusters’.Thus proving Archimedes death ray as no longer a theory but a definitely possibility that this ‘death ray’ tactic was used against the roman ships in Syracuse.\nArchimedes Death Ray: Testing with MythBusters\nMathematics:\nMostly known as inventor of mechanical devices, we cannot ignore Archimedes’ contribution to Mathematics.\nBeing unhappy with the existing one, Archimedes is known to have invented his own Greek number system, so that he could accommodate more of his invented numbers.\nAccording to some, the greatest invention of Archimedes is ‘integral calculus’.

This principle is known as ‘integration’. Also a part of the discovery of ‘integral calculus’ is ‘differential calculus’. He calculated ways to approximate the slope of the tangent lines of his figures.\nIn the ‘Measurement of Circle’ Archimedes discovers the value of the square root of 3 as being more than 265/153 (approximately 1.732) and less than 1351/780 (approximately 1.7320512). The accurate value is rounded to 1.7320508076. He aquainted us with this principle without offering any explaination.\nIn ‘The Quadrature of the Parabola’, Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4/3 multiplied by the area of a triangle with equal base and height.\nIn ‘The Sand Reckoner’, he set out the impossible task of calculating the number of sand grains the universe could contain. He challenged that it was not impossible to do, even if sand grains were too large to be counted. His friend King Gelo thought this was hardly possible. To solve the problem of sand grains, Archimedes invented a system based around the myriad or uncountable in Greek. It also denoted 10,000 in the Greek number system. He fixed a number system using powers of myriads (100 million) and finally calculated the number of sand grains in the universe as 8×1063 ."

Here's a list of some of those who dragged mankind from the days when fire and the wheel were life-changing discoveries, into an age where computers and nuclear missiles are fast becoming things of the past.\nAdvertisement\nThere was a time when man used to make fire by rubbing flints together, roast some meat on the delicate flame, devour it quickly before some other predator caught the scent, and then sleep on the cold, possibly bug-ridden soil. Ideas of a usual modern 'evening plan', may it be nightclubs, a movie, a date, or a lazy dinner in front of the TV, were light years beyond the wildest of dreams. Ever wondered about the people who have made such significant contributions to making our lives so much easier? Let's take a look at those responsible for kick-starting humanity's march towards such an age of modernity and advancement.\nHarbingers of Modernity\nNote: The list has been compiled in an alphabetical sequence of surnames.\nA\nArchimedes\nIt is perhaps fitting that Archimedes should lead the lineup of great inventors, even in an alphabetical fashion. Archimedes was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer and an inventor, producing his best work in the 3rd century BC. His contributions have been invaluable in several fields, but there are some inventions which have made him a cult icon. Some of his famous inventions include the Archimedean Screw, which was developed in order to remove flooded water from ships. It included a large screw fitted inside a cylinder. As the screw was turned, water progressively rose into the subsequent grooves, ultimately gushing out at the open end. The Archimedean screw was turned by hand and could also be used to transfer water from a low-lying body of water into an irrigation canal. Till date, the Archimedean screw (or its fundamental principle) is used in pumps. Archimedes is also famous for the (possibly apocryphal) anecdote of his discovery of the Archimedes' Principle upon entering the bathtub and rushing out naked in the joy of having found a solution.\nEdwin H. Armstrong\nA groundbreaking researcher and inventor in the field of radio, Edwin Howard Armstrong invented the FM transmission. The FM radio has, to a majority of people, become as important a tool in having a cheerful morning as a bath or a cup of coffee. Edwin Armstrong is the one we have to thank for that.\nJohn Vincent Atanasoff\nAtanasoff is credited with inventing perhaps the most ubiquitous device in the modern world -- the digital computer. The 'computer' built by Atanasoff was only designed to be used for 'computing', rather than in the form of the entertainment hubs of today. However, it would be a grave folly to underestimate its importance, considering the indispensable place it has gone on to command in all of our lives.\nB\nCharles Babbage\nAtanasoff may have invented the digital computer, but the computer, per se, was invented by the English mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer Charles Babbage. He came up with the concept of a programmable computer and is said to have invented the first mechanical computer in the 19th century.\nAlexander Graham Bell\nThe telephone, a fairly vital device in modern times, was invented by Alexander Graham Bell. Bell's wife and mother were deaf, inspiring him to perform extensive research into elocution and speech for the deaf. This research ultimately led to the invention of the world's first telephone.\nKarl Benz\nAlthough the rising gasoline prices might seem like a nightmare now, you have to admit that a life without cars would have been pretty boring. And slow! Well, thank god for Karl Friedrich Benz, the German engine designer and automobile engineer who invented the gasoline-powered automobile.\nLaszlo Biro\nLaszlo Biro was the inventor of the modern ballpoint pen. The ballpoints were much more efficient than the prevalent ink pens, and stained much less. Ballpoint pens are known as biro in many English-speaking countries after its inventor (despite it being a registered trademark and legally necessitating its usage with a capital 'B').\nClarence Birdseye\nRemember all those times when you are just too tired to cook after you have slogged through your job in the day? Isn't frozen food a lifesaver at times like these? You need to thank Clarence Frank Birdseye II, the American inventor who is considered the founder of the modern frozen food industry.\nNils Bohlin\nSeat belts are nowadays considered a basic preventive device, and are fitted in cars by default. It started with Nils Bohlin inventing the three-point safety belts. Bohlin, who was a versatile engineer, was also responsible for the development of the ejector seat in airplanes.\nLouis Braille\nLouis Braille was the inventor of the eponymous Braille script. Braille, who was blind himself, developed the first draft of the script in 1824; it was perfected around 1940. The Braille script has proved to be an invaluable means of communication and comprehension for the blind.\nJohn Browning\nJohn Browning was the inventor of modern automatic and semi-automatic firearms and has as many as 128 gun patents to his name. Browning was a pioneering late-19th century designer, and brought about several important changes in the existing design of firearms. Chief among these was the telescoping bolt, a system which facilitated a reduction in the length of rifles, thus making them easier to point and handle. The telescopic bolt has been used ever since, with minimal modification.\nC - D\nGeorge W. Carver\nCarver was born in slavery in or around 1864, and was raised by his master Moses Carver and his wife, both of whom were opposed to slavery. Carver worked towards eliminating the monopoly of cotton in Southern US plantations by introducing alternate crops which would replenish the soil while providing nutrition to the laborers themselves. Primary among the crops he promoted were peanuts, which he researched upon extensively and modified to create several products, such as peanut butter, dyes, paints and cosmetics. Carver is sometimes credited as the father of chemurgy (an applied science of modifying and manipulating agricultural raw products to create industrial products), due to the vast number of products he was able to produce from previously ignored crops such as peanuts, sweet potatoes and soya beans.\nSir Henry Cole\nHenry Cole, who was an English civil servant, is credited with the invention and popularization of commercial Christmas cards. He was knighted in 1875 for his stellar contribution in organizing and expanding the 'Great Exhibitions', which would become a hallmark feature of the 19th century. One of his first Christmas cards (1843) fetched GBP 22,500 in a 2001 auction! Perhaps he should be called Santa Cole, then!\nBartolomeo Cristofori\nBartolomeo Cristofori was an Italian maker of musical instruments. He is generally regarded as the inventor of the piano. However, any musical instrument has to undergo several modifications in order for it to reach its final form. Thus, Cristofori's claim as the sole inventor can be refuted, although he definitely had the most prominent role in the development of the instrument.\nWilliam K. Dickson *\nWilliam Kennedy Laurie Dickson was an Anglo-Scottish inventor who created an early motion picture camera, while under the employment of Thomas Edison. He also invented the first practical celluloid film, and set the standard for its size by going for a 35 mm configuration, which is practiced even to this day.\nRudolf Diesel\nRudolf Christian Karl Diesel was a German inventor who is known for his invention of the diesel engine. The fuel, which is much more efficient than petrol, was named after him. Diesel's death was controversial; he disappeared aboard a steamer and was identified days later, on the strength of his personal belongings having been found on a corpse.\nE\nGeorge Eastman\nGeorge Eastman was the man who invented the roll film, which was not only a great boost for the art of photography, but also became the basis for the invention of motion picture films. Eastman founded Kodak, a popular photographic equipment company even to this day, in 1889.\nThomas Edison\nThomas Alva Edison is best known as the inventor of the light bulb and the widespread commercialization of electricity, but he was also the man behind the phonograph, and the development of the video camera*. Edison is the fourth most prolific inventor in history, and holds more than 2300 patents worldwide, almost 1100 of them American.\nWillem Einthoven\nWillem Einthoven was a Dutch doctor and physiologist. He invented the first practical electrocardiogram, also known as ECG.\nDouglas Engelbart\nHaving already written about the inventors of computers, here comes the inventor of the mouse. Dr. Douglas Engelbart is well-known for his research in user-computer interactions, culminating in the invention of the mouse.\nF\nMichael Faraday\nFaraday is known for his invention of the Faraday rotator and the Faraday cage. Faraday also discovered the laws of electrolysis and popularized terminology such as anode, cathode, electrode, and ion, terms largely created by William Whewell.\nAlexander Fleming\nAlexander Fleming is popular for his discovery of the antibiotic Penicillin from the fungus Penicillium rubens (the particular fungus is also thought to be P. notatum or P. chrysogenum) in the year 1928. He also discovered lysozymes in 1922.\nBenjamin Franklin\nBenjamin Franklin is famous for inventing the lightning rod and the accompanying anecdote of him having flown a kite in a storm in order to prove his hypothesis. He also invented bifocals, the Franklin stove, a carriage odometer, and also a musical instrument known as glass armonica. Franklin was a noted polymath, and was a central figure in early American politics; he was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.\nWilliam Friese-Greene *\nWilliam Friese-Greene is known as a pioneer in the field of motion pictures and also known as the inventor of cinematography.\nG\nDennis Gabor\nDennis Gabor was a Hungarian electrical engineer who invented holography. Holography is the technique used primarily to create commercially used holograms. It is a technique of capturing visual input (laser). However, in contrast to photographs, which only capture the light coming towards a specific direction, holographs capture the light scattered towards all directions, thus showing different layers of the image at different viewing angles.\nBette Nesmith Graham\nBette Nesmith Graham was the inventor of Liquid Paper, which is the brand name of opaque correction fluid used to cover up mistakes on paper without retyping the entire sheet. It was invented by Graham to mask the numerous typing mistakes made by herself and her colleagues, but has now developed to become the primary handwriting correction fluid.\nJohann Gutenberg\nJohann Gutenberg is known as the man who was the first European to use movable type printing, in around 1439. But more importantly, he was the one who invented mechanical printing. Mechanical printing facilitated a much faster and wider distribution of written text, since it could be done in an infinitesimal time compared to reproducing the manuscript by hand. The Bible was the first book thus printed.\nH - L\nElias Howe\nElias Howe was an American inventor who pioneered the sewing machine. Sewing machines had been formulated and built -- albeit on a small scale -- before Howe, but Howe's design was the first to incorporate a lockstitch mechanism. The lockstitch mechanism provided a much stronger stitch than existing designs.\nWhitcomb L. Judson\nWhitcomb L. Judson was an American inventor who developed and marketed the forerunner of the modern zipper in 1893. It was called the clasp-locker. Elias Howe had created the original design of the clasp locker, but didn't carry on with the idea. Judson used the basic idea of Howe's patented design, while making some useful modifications of his own.\nJohn Kellogg\nCornflakes are one of the most popular morning snacks all over the world. These crunchy delights were invented around 1900. John Kellogg invented cornflakes, with help from his brother Will Kellogg. Although his views on holistic health were controversial and would almost certainly be rejected in modern times on grounds of humanity, it can't be doubted that at least one of his inventions has gone on to become a universal favorite.\nRene Laennec\nOne of the most important inventions in the medical field is the stethoscope. Rene Laennec was a physician who invented the stethoscope. Before the invention of the stethoscope, physicians used to listen to the heartbeats of a patient by directly pressing their ears against the patient's chest. Laennec was once consulted by an obese patient, and couldn't discern the distinct pattern of heartbeats because of the extreme fatness. Thus, he made a crude early stethoscope by rolling up a newspaper and applying the tube to the patient's chest. Seeing that he could hear the heartbeats much clearer in this fashion, he designed and created the first stethoscope.\nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek\nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek is best known for his work on the improvement of the microscope. He created over 400 different types of microscopes, and also pioneered research in lenses. His research and work in creating microscopes founded the field of microbiology, earning him the title 'the father of microbiology'.\nM\nGuglielmo Marconi\nGuglielmo Marconi was an Italian inventor who invented the radiotelegraph system in 1895. Although Marconi is generally given the credit for inventing the radio, Heinrich Hertz had validated the underlying principle in 1888 (Hertz passed away in 1894), and Jagadish Chandra Bose had demonstrated the practical use of radio waves a year before Marconi's invention.\nDmitri Mendeleev\nKnown popularly as the father of the periodic table of the elements, Dmitri Mendeleev created the first version of the periodic table of elements. Although Mendeleev's periodic table was largely incomplete, he deliberately left 'blanks' in the progression, predicting (often correctly) the properties of the absent elements.\nRobert Moog\nDr. Robert Arthur Moog was an American pioneer of electronic music, best known as the inventor of the Moog synthesizer. The Moog synthesizer was highly popular from the late 1960s to the 80s. The electrical design used by Moog was later used in numerous other synthesizers.\nSamuel Morse\nSamuel Morse invented the single wire telegraph system, and co-invented the Morse code, which is named after him. Morse was also an accomplished painter. He was a well-known anti-Catholic, to the extent of not taking his hat off when meeting the Pope on a visit to Rome. He was also a vocal proponent of slavery (although this should be viewed in the light of it being the socially accepted custom at the time).\nN - P\nJames Naismith\nJames Naismith invented the massively popular sport of basketball in 1891 and is also credited with inventing the first football helmet. Basketball was admitted into the 1936 Olympics, just three years before Naismith's death. For his pioneering contributions to basketball, he was posthumously included in the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame, Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame and the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, among others.\nNicephore Niepce\nNicephore Niepce was a French inventor, who is known as the inventor of modern photography. After realizing that he did not have a steady hand required to trace the images created by the camera obscura (a rudimentary early version of the camera), Niepce created a camera with bitumen. This required several hours of exposure for an image to be created, but paved the way for future developments in cameras and photography.\nNiepce is also credited with inventing the world's first internal combustion engine, patented in 1807.\nLes Paul\nLovers of Rock and Roll should know that Les Paul is the inventor of the solid-body electric guitar, without which the modern music scene would have taken a drastically different turn. In addition to the invention of the vital instrument, Paul influenced Rock and Roll by promoting already invented (but unpopular) techniques in recording, and delay effects. He also introduced new fretting and chording techniques that are followed by many modern guitarists.\nJohn Pemberton\nCan't live without your daily can of cola? Ever wondered who invented it? An American pharmacist called John Stith Pemberton invented Coca-Cola. Although the present form of Coca-Cola (along with other aerated drinks) has generated negative criticism for its adverse health effects, Pemberton's original formula was marketed as a brain tonic and a cure for headaches.\nJames L. Plimpton\nJames Leonard Plimpton was an American inventor whom every skater should thank. He is the man who invented and patented roller skates in 1863. He strove to promote skating, and opened some of the earliest skating rinks in the US.\nR\nCharles Richter\nCharles Richter is the co-inventor (along with Beno Gutenberg, although the sole use of Richter's name is now practically standard) of the Richter magnitude scale, which is used to measure the magnitude of earthquakes, although it is no longer the primary method. Richter had a keen interest in seismology (the study of earthquakes and the waves generated by them) since childhood.\nWilhelm C. Rontgen\nWilhelm Conrad Rontgen won the 1901 Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of X-rays, a vital tool in diagnostics. X-rays were viewed suspiciously and even considered evil by the masses, and Rontgen had to demonstrate the technology on himself -- due to a lack of volunteers -- on numerous occasions. This resulted in a tragic death, having contracted intestinal cancer from overexposure to X-rays.\nErno Rubik\nYes, you guessed it right! Erno Rubik is a Hungarian inventor, sculptor and professor of architecture, who invented several popular mechanical puzzles such as Rubik's Cube, Rubik's Magic and Rubik's Snake. He was born during the Second World War -- 1944 -- in Hungary. Despite being the inventor of the toy, he rarely attends 'speedcubing' meets, and is known to be an introvert.\nS\nAdolphe Sax\nAs can be deduced from the name, Adolphe Sax invented the saxophone. The name of the famous jazz instrument literally means 'the voice of Sax'. Sax himself was an accomplished flutist and clarinetist, and his keen passion for musical instruments, coupled with musical training, led him to create an instrument that has gone on to become as important as any.\nIgor Sikorsky\nIgor Sikorsky was a Russian-American aviator and designer, who invented and flew the world's first multi-engine fixed-wing aircraft. He developed the first flying boats of the Pan American Airways fleet in the 1930s. He also developed the now-standard rotor configuration in helicopters, with the VS-300, and went on to produce the first mass-produced helicopter, the Sikorsky R-4.\nLevi Strauss\nAll fashion gurus will agree that a pair of blue jeans is a must-have! Well, kudos to the man who invented it, Levi Strauss. Strauss received a patent for the denim work trousers in 1873, the same year he founded the oldest jeans company in the world -- Levi Strauss & Co.\nT - V\nEdward Teller\nEdward Teller was the inventor of the hydrogen bomb; despite often being called 'the father of the hydrogen bomb', Teller himself didn't appreciate the epithet. Teller was a part of the Manhattan Project, where he first proposed fusion-based weapons. However, his plans, which were inherently more complicated, difficult to execute and time-consuming, were postponed to be pursued after the War. It was designed and tested in the early 1950s. Edward Teller was an advocate of nuclear energy, including weapons, polarizing opinions about him.\nJohn Venn\nVenn diagrams may be boring to learn, but the system put in place by John Venn is helpful in numerous fields, such as logic and set theory. Venn was a keen walker and mountain climber and a proficient amateur linguist.\nLeonardo da Vinci\nDa Vinci is popular particularly for the Mona Lisa, and the prominent role he holds in the bestselling fiction The Da Vinci Code. He was a stunning polymath, and a prolific inventor. He designed several military and civil devices, including flying machines similar to hang gliders and helicopters, in the 16th century -- more than 300 years before the first flight by the Wright brothers. Many of his designs have been constructed by enthusiastic amateurs, including the fictional Jacques Sauniere in The Da Vinci Code.\nAlessandro Volta\nAlessandro Volta is known for the invention of the first electric cell in 1800. Although the cell was very inefficient and slightly dangerous (especially if the need arose for transportation) due to the inclusion of sulfuric acid, it opened up a direction very few had previously even considered. The unit of measurement for electric potential, volts, is named in honor of Alessandro Volta."

The meaning of the word originates with the Viking berserkers, the fierce warriors who were known for battling in an uncontrollable, trance-like fury, and were alleged to be able to perform seemingly impossible super-human feats of strength.\nIn medieval Norse and Germanic history and folklore, the berserkers were described as members of an unruly warrior gang that worshipped Odin, the supreme Norse deity, and were commissioned to royal and noble courts as bodyguards and ‘shock troops’, who would strike fear into all who encountered them. Adding to their ferocity, and in order to intimidate the enemy, they would wear bear and wolf pelts when they fought, giving them the name Berserker, meaning “bear coat” in Old Norse.\nThe berserkers wore wolf and bear pelts. Image source .\nThe fury of the berserkers would start with chills and teeth chattering and give way to a purpling of the face, as they literally became ‘hot-headed’, and culminating in a great, uncontrollable rage accompanied by grunts and howls. They would bite into their shields and gnaw at their skin before launching into battle, indiscriminately injuring, maiming and killing anything in their path.\nDating back as far as the ninth century, the berserker Norse Warriors were said to be able to do things that normal humans could not. According to ancient legend, the berserkers were indestructible, and no weapon could break them from their trance.  They were described as being immune to fire and to the strike of a sword, continuing on their rampage despite injury. The Icelandic historian and poet Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241 AD) wrote the following description of berserkers in his Ynglinga saga:\nHis (Odin's) men rushed forwards without armour, were as mad as dogs or wolves, bit their shields, and were strong as bears or wild oxen, and killed people at a blow, but neither fire nor iron told upon them.\nIt is believed that this account is partially true and that their trance-like state actually prevented them from feeling pain until after the battle.\nWhile some researchers believe the Berserkers simply worked themselves up into a self-induced hysteria before fighting, others maintain that it was sorcery, the consumption of drugs or alcohol, or even mental illness, that accounted for their behaviour. Some botanists have claimed that berserker behaviour could have been caused by the ingestion of the plant known as bog myrtle, one of the main spices in Scandinavian alcoholic beverages.\nOther more esoteric theories surround supernatural beliefs. For instance, some scholars have claimed that the Vikings believed in spirit possession and that berserkers were possessed by the animal spirits of wolves or bears. According to some theorists, berserkers learned to cultivate the ability to allow animal spirits to take over their body during a fight (an example of animal totemism) that also involved drinking the blood of the animal that they wished to be possessed by.\nIn 1015, Jarl Eiríkr Hákonarson of Norway outlawed berserkers, and Grágás, the medieval Icelandic law code, sentenced berserker warriors to outlawry. By the 12th century, organised berserker war-gangs had been completely disbanded.\nFeatured image: The Viking Berserkers. Image source: wiki.totalwar.com"

This condition has been described as follows:\nThis fury, which was called berserkergang, occurred not only in the heat of battle, but also during laborious work. Men who were thus seized performed things which otherwise seemed impossible for human power. This condition is said to have begun with shivering, chattering of the teeth, and chill in the body, and then the face swelled and changed its color. With this was connected a great hot-headedness, which at last gave over into a great rage, under which they howled as wild animals, bit the edge of their shields, and cut down everything they met without discriminating between friend or foe. When this condition ceased, a great dulling of the mind and feebleness followed, which could last for one or several days.\nSee also: Norse Vikings serving the Byzantine Emperor as Mercenaries\nTheories about what caused berserker behavior include ingestion of materials with psychoactive properties, psychological processes, and medical conditions.\nModern scholars believe certain examples of berserker rage to have been induced voluntarily by the consumption of drugs such as the hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly Amanita, or massive amounts of alcohol. While such practices would fit in with ritual usages, other explanations for the berserker’s madness have been put forward, including self-induced hysteria, epilepsy, mental illness or genetics.\n…\nText modified by: Thor Lanesskog, ThorNews\nSource: Wikipedia"

    "content": "The Devoted Intellect\nIvar the Boneless: Viking Warrior Gumby or Sufferer of Brittle Bone Disease?\nA new edition of The Intellectual Devotional, this time with a focus on Biographies, will be available online and in stores on May 11.  (Click here to pre-order your copy.) As the release date approaches, “The Devoted Intellect” blog will introduce and expand on material from that book. Today’s entry on “Ivar the Boneless” draws from the “Leaders” section of the Biographies edition.\nIvarr Ragnarsson, nicknamed Ivar the Boneless, was a Danish or Swedish Viking chieftain and by reputation also a berserker (Norse warriors who reportedly fought in a nearly uncontrollable, possibly drug induced, trance-like fury). Unsurprisingly, every Viking historian worth his or her salt has a theory about the origins of Ivar’s unusual nickname. Some have suggested “boneless” was a euphemism for impotence (doubtful) or even a snake metaphor (he had a brother named Snake-Eye). However,  it seems unlikely that the famous Ivar earned his epithet from his less illustrious brother, thank you very much. Still others have opined that his moniker might have referred his impressive physical flexibility, and that his “limberness” might have given rise to the popular notion that he was “boneless.”\nA few historians have enlivened this debate with their convincing theory that the signs and symptoms of Ivar’s condition, as described in the Scandinavian sagas, are consistent with the etiology of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). More commonly known as “brittle bone disease,” osteogenesis imperfecta is a dominant congenital disorder that causes extremely fragile bones, and is most frequently caused by defect in the gene that produces type 1 collagen, an important building block of bone. Thus, people with OI are extremely susceptible to fractures.\nIn 1949, the Dane Knud Seedorf published “Osteogenesis imperfecta: A study of clinical features and heredity based on 55 Danish families,” where he wrote:\n“Of historical personages the author knows of only one of whom we have a vague suspicion that he suffered from osteogenesis imperfecta, namely Ivar Benløs, eldest son of the Danish legendary king Regnar Lodbrog. He is reported to have had legs as soft as cartilage (‘he lacked bones’), so that he was unable to walk and had to be carried about on a shield.”\nIn 2003 Nabil Shaban, a disability rights advocate with osteogenesis imperfecta, made the documentary “The Strangest Viking” for British television, in which he explored the possibility that Ivar the Boneless may have had the same condition as himself. It also demonstrated that someone with the condition was quite capable of using a longbow, and so could have taken part in battle, a prerequisite for a leader in the notoriously bellicose Viking society.\nAs fascinating as the osteogenesis imperfecta theory is, one glaring question still remains unanswered; how did Ivar achieve such widespread fame as a warrior in Viking society if he could not even walk unassisted?\nEven if he possessed a rare talent for the crossbow, the fierce Viking people valued prowess on the battlefield above all else, and it seems highly unlikely that they would allow a physically disabled person to act as chieftain. Thus, a simpler explanation for Ivar’s sobriquet seems more likely. It has been plausibly suggested that the origin of Ivar’s nickname comes from the English word “bone,” which is cognate with the German word “Bein”, meaning “leg”. The Scandinavian sagas mention that Ivar the Boneless was carried off the battlefield on a shield by his warriors, a common practice in those days. Thus, Ivar may earned the nicknamed “boneless” simply because he was frequently observed being carried off the battlefield after his many victories."

I had read that some people 'trained', some sources claim that the trait was hereditary, and others claim that they ingested psychadelic drugs prior to battle? Can someone please explain, thanks!\n\"Berserkers (or berserks) were Norse warriors who are primarily reported in the Old Norse literature to have fought in a nearly uncontrollable, trance-like fury, a characteristic which later gave rise to the English word berserk. Berserkers are attested to in numerous Old Norse sources. Most historians believe that berserkers worked themselves into a rage before battle, but some think that they might have consumed drugged foods. The Úlfhéðnar (singular Úlfheðinn), another term associated with berserkers, mentioned in the Vatnsdœla saga, Haraldskvæði and the Völsunga saga, were said to wear the pelt of a wolf when they entered battle.[1] Úlfhéðnar are sometimes described as Odin's special warriors: \"[Odin’s] men went without their mailcoats and were mad as hounds or wolves, bit their shields...they slew men, but neither fire nor iron had effect upon them. This is called 'going berserk.'\"[2] In addition, the helm-plate press from Torslunda depicts (below) a scene of Odin with a berserker—\"a wolf skinned warrior with the apparently one-eyed dancer in the bird-horned helm, which is generally interpreted as showing a scene indicative of a relationship between berserkgang... and the god Odin[3]\"—with a wolf pelt and a spear as distinguishing features.[4]\""

Most historians believe that berserkers worked themselves into a rage before battle, but some think that they might have consumed drugged foods.\nThe Úlfhéðnar (singular Úlfheðinn), another term associated with berserkers, mentioned in the Vatnsdœla saga , Haraldskvæði and the Völsunga saga , were said to wear the pelt of a wolf when they entered battle. [1] Úlfhéðnar are sometimes described as Odin's special warriors: \"[Odin’s] men went without their mailcoats and were mad as hounds or wolves, bit their shields…they slew men, but neither fire nor iron had effect upon them. This is called 'going berserk. [2] '\" In addition, the helm-plate press from Torslunda depicts (below) a scene of Odin with a berserker—\"a wolf skinned warrior with the dancer in the bird-horned helm, which is generally interpreted as showing a scene indicative of a relationship between berserkgang… and the god Odin [3] \"—with a wolf pelt and a spear as distinguishing features. [4]\nEdit\nThe name berserker derives from the Old Norse berserkr (plural berserkir). This expression most likely arose from their reputed habit of wearing a kind of shirt or coat (serkr) made from the pelt of a bear (ber-) during battle.\nThe element ber- was sometimes interpreted as berr-, meaning \"bare\", which Snorri understood to mean that the warriors went into battle bare-chested, or \"without armor\" as men of Odin. [5] This view has since been largely abandoned. [6]\nTerminology\nEdit\nTo \"go berserk\" was to “hamask” which translates as “change form,\" in this case, a with the sense \"enter a state of wild fury\" and one who could transform as a berserker was typically thought of as “hamrammr” or “shapestrong. [7] ” For example, the band of men that go with Skallagrim in Egil’s Saga to see King Harald about his brother, Thorolf’s murder, they are described as, \"all together there were twelve of them in the party, all the hardest of men, with a touch of the uncanny about a number of them…they [were] built and shaped more like trolls than human beings,\" which is generally interpreted as this band of men being hamrammr. [8]\nAttestations\nGerhard Munthe (1899)\nBerserkers appear prominently in a multitude of other sagas and poems, many of which describe berserkers as ravenous men who loot, plunder, and kill indiscriminately. Later, by Christian interpreters, the berserk was even viewed as a \"heathen devil. [9] \"\nThe earliest surviving reference to the term \"berserker\" is in Haraldskvæði , a skaldic poem composed by Thórbiörn Hornklofi in the late 9th century in honour of King Harald Fairhair , as ulfheðnar (\"men clad in wolf skins\"). This translation from the Haraldskvæði saga describes Harald's berserkers:\nI'll ask of the berserks, you tasters of blood, Those intrepid heroes, how are they treated,\nThose who wade out into battle?\nWolf-skinned they are called. In battle\nThey bear bloody shields.\nRed with blood are their spears when they come to fight.\nThey form a closed group.\nThe prince in his wisdom puts trust in such men\nWho hack through enemy shields. [10]\nThe Icelandic historian and poet Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241) wrote the following description of berserkers in his Ynglinga saga :\nHis (Odin's) men rushed forwards without armour, were as mad as dogs or wolves, bit their shields, and were strong as bears or wild oxen, and killed people at a blow, but neither fire nor iron told upon them. This was called Berserkergang. [11]\nKing Harald Fairhair's use of berserker \" shock troops \" broadened his sphere of influence. Other Scandinavian kings used berserkers as part of their army of hirdmen and sometimes ranked them as equivalent to a royal bodyguard. It may be that some of those warriors only adopted the organization or rituals of berserk männerbünde , or used the name as a deterrent or claim of their ferocity.\nEmphasis has been placed on the frenzied nature of the berserkers, hence the modern sense of the word 'berserk.' However, the sources describe several other characteristics that have been ignored or neglected by modern commentators. Snorri's assertion that 'neither fire nor iron told upon them' is reiterated time after time, and the sources frequently state that neither edged weapons nor fire affected the berserks, although they were not immune to clubs or other blunt instruments. For example:\nmen asked Halfdan to attack Hardbeen and his champions man by man; and he not only promised to fight, but assured himself the victory with most confident words. When Hardbeen heard this, a demoniacal frenzy suddenly took him; he furiously bit and devoured the edges of his shield; he kept gulping down fiery coals; he snatched live embers in his mouth and let them pass down into his entrails; he rushed through the perils of crackling fires; and at last, when he had raved through every sort of madness, he turned his sword with raging hand against the hearts of six of his champions. It is doubtful whether this madness came from thirst for battle or natural ferocity. Then with the remaining band of his champions he attacked Halfdan, who crushed him with a hammer of wondrous size, so that he lost both victory and life; paying the penalty both to Halfdan, whom he had challenged, and to the kings whose offspring he had violently ravished... [12]\nSimilarly, Hrolf Kraki 's champions refuse to retreat 'from fire or iron.' Another frequent motif refers to berserkers blunting their enemy's blades with spells, or a glance from their evil eyes. This appears as early as Beowulf where it is a characteristic attributed to Grendel . Both the fire eating and the immunity to edged weapons are reminiscent of tricks popularly ascribed to Hindu fakirs .\nIn 1015, Jarl Eiríkr Hákonarson of Norway outlawed berserkers. Grágás , the medieval Icelandic law code, sentenced berserker warriors to outlawry. By the 12th century, organised berserker war-bands had disappeared.\nThe Lewis Chessmen , found on the Isle of Lewis (Outer Hebrides, Scotland) but thought to be of Norse manufacture, include Berserkers depicted biting their shields.\nTheories\nEdit\nScholar Hilda Ellis-Davidson draws a parallel between berserkers and the mention by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII (AD 905–959) in his book De cerimoniis aulae byzantinae (\"Book of Ceremonies of the Byzantine court\") of a \"Gothic Dance\" performed by members of his Varangian Guard (Norse warriors working in the service of the Byzantine Empire ), who took part wearing animal skins and masks: she believes this may have been connected with berserker rites. [13]\nThe actual fit of madness the berserker experienced was referred to as berserkergang (\"going berserk\"). This condition has been described as follows:\nThis fury, which was called berserkergang, occurred not only in the heat of battle, but also during laborious work. Men who were thus seized performed things which otherwise seemed impossible for human power. This condition is said to have begun with shivering, chattering of the teeth, and chill in the body, and then the face swelled and changed its colour. With this was connected a great hot-headedness, which at last gave over into a great rage, under which they howled as wild animals, bit the edge of their shields, and cut down everything they met without discriminating between friend or foe. When this condition ceased, a great dulling of the mind and feebleness followed, which could last for one or several days. [14]\nTheories about what caused berserker behaviour include ingestion of materials with psychoactive properties, psychological processes, and medical conditions .\nSome scholars believe certain examples of berserker rage to have been induced voluntarily by the consumption of drugs such as the hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria . [15] or massive amounts of alcohol. [16] While such practices would fit in with ritual usages, other explanations for the berserker's madness have been put forward, including self-induced hysteria , epilepsy , mental illness or genetics. [17]\nJonathan Shay, MD , makes an explicit connection between the berserker rage of soldiers and the hyperarousal of post-traumatic stress disorder . In Achilles in Vietnam he writes:\nIf a soldier survives the berserk state, it imparts emotional deadness and vulnerability to explosive rage to his psychology and permanent hyperarousal to his physiology — hallmarks of post-traumatic stress disorder in combat veterans. My clinical experience with Vietnam combat veterans prompts me to place the berserk state at the heart of their most severe psychological and psychophysiological injuries. [18]\nModern context\nEdit\nThe word \"berserker\" today applies to anyone who fights with reckless abandon and disregard to even his own life, a concept used during the Vietnam War and in Vietnam-inspired literature ( Michael Herr 's Dispatches) and film ( Oliver Stone 's Platoon and Adrian Lyne 's Jacob's Ladder). \"Going berserk\" in this context refers to an  of adrenaline -induced opioids (or military-issued amphetamine for long missions) in the human body and brain leading a soldier to fight with fearless rage and indifference, a state strikingly similar to that of the 9th century berserkers.\n\"Going berserk\" is also used colloquially to describe a person who is acting in a wild rage or in an uncontrolled and irrational manner. \"Berserker\" is also a well known character archetype and status in video games and other media.\nIn popular culture\nBerserkers are also featured in Microsoft's Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings and its expansion The Conquerors as a Viking unique unit.\nBerserkers feature as one of Denmark's unique units, replacing the Longswordsman, in a piece of DLC for Firaxis Games ' Civilization V that added Denmark as a playable civilization.\nBerserkers feature fairly prominately in Rome Total War as a Germanic unit that has high attack and impossible to control once berserk.\nThe character Olaf sings a song titled \"Berserker\" in the movie Clerks .\nIn the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime, sometimes the Eva units, when in great danger of being destroyed enter in a \"Berserker Mode\".\nIn the Berserk manga and anime, the main protagonist Guts often goes into berserker trance.\nIn the book Sabriel the character Touchstone has the ability to go into a type of berserker state\nIn the Vinland Saga manga, one character, Bjorn, occasionally eats a \"mushroom of the Berserker\" and goes into a temporary violent trance, seeming to not initially feel severe injury, and is unable or unwilling to tell friend from foe.\nJoe Abercrombie 's first series of fantasy novels, The First Law trilogy, feature a major protagonist, Logen Ninefingers, who suffers from an apparently involuntary form of beserk rage that transforms him into a mad, unstoppable killing machine that refers to itself as The Bloody-Nine.\nIn the online strategic game Forge Of Empires is the Berserker used as a soldier in High Middle Ages epoch.\nThe Berserkers is also the name of John Pope's group of fighters from \"Falling Skies\" on TNT.\nIn the video game series Dragon Age , it is a specialization available to the player if playing a warrior character, and also available to companions of the warrior class in the first game. It was created by dwarves and taught to the other races when some dwarves began to left their homeland. It specializes in channel the rage of the warrior to deliver deadlier attacks.\nThe beserker state is referred to towards the end of Thud! , the 34th Discworld novel by Terry Pratchett , when the hero Commander Samuel Vimes ends up pursuing the 'deep-down' dwarves (responsible for various murders, causing political unrest and an attempted attack on Vimes' own family) through caves below Koom Valley . Rendered temporarily mad by his physical and mental exhaustion, the pain from the fall into the mine, possession by a 'quasi-demonic entity' called the Summoning Dark and terror due to not being able to read the bedtime story ' Where's My Cow ' to his young son, Vimes mercilessly attacks all the dwarves standing between him and the deep-downers - as Pratchett notes, \"Against the beserker there is no defence\".\nIn the Redwall series, a condition known as Bloodwrath has been based on this by the series' author, Brian Jacques .\nIn the video game Grand Theft Auto V the character Trevor Phillips is able to take drastically reduced damage while dealing increased damage due to entering an enraged state.\nIn Alexander Gordon Smith's third book, from the series Escape from Furnace, titled Death Sentence, the main protagnist Alex Sawyer encounters a mutated creature called a berserker in which he describes it as a creature of pure unstoppable rage and destruction; later on the Warden send 2 more advanced berserkers to kill all the prisoners of furnace until Alex, empowered with the nector that created the berserkers in the first place, gains enough strength and rage to fight off the berserkers and even kills one with a tank full of gas. In the fourth book entitled fugitives Alex slowly becomes a berserker, due to being bitten by one in the third book; after being mostly transformed and challenging the Warden he injects himself with a new form of nector, turning himself into a more lethal form of berserker so he could fight Alex; Alex drinks his blood in order to further mutate himself  and kills the Warden. In the fifth book entitled Execution, Alex loses all of his sanity & humanity and has become the most powerful berserker in the world; Alex full of murderous rage vows to kill the one who turned him into a berserker and created the nector.\nSee also\n↑ Howard D.

    "content": "Unique Facts about Canada:  The Hudson Bay Company\nHudson Bay Company\nThe Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) is the oldest corporation in Canada (and North America) and is one of the oldest in the world still in existence. Its initials have often been farcically interpreted as \"Here Before Christ\". From its longtime headquarters at York Factory on Hudson Bay it controlled the fur trade throughout much of British-controlled North America for several centuries, undertaking early exploration and functioning as the de facto government in many areas of the continent prior to the arrival of large-scale settlement. Its traders and trappers forged early relationships with many groups of First Nations/Native Americans and its network of trading posts formed the nucleus for later official authority in many areas of western Canada and the United States. In the late 19th century its vast territory became the largest component in the newly formed Dominion of Canada, in which the company was the largest private landowner. With the decline of the fur trade, the company evolved into mercantile business selling vital goods to settlers in the Canadian West. Today the company is best known for its department stores throughout Canada.\nIn the 17th century the French had a monopoly on the Canadian fur trade. However, two French traders, Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers, feeling themselves to have been victimized by the French aristocracy, approached a group of businessmen in Boston, Massachusetts to help finance their explorations. The route Radisson and Groseilliers discovered led to rich trading grounds to the north and west of Lake Superior, which they said could be reached from the north through Hudson Bay instead of over land from New France. The Bostonians readily agreed and brought the two to England to elicit financing.\nIn 1668, the English commissioned two ships, the Nonsuch and the Eaglet to explore possible trade into Hudson Bay. The Nonsuch was commanded by Captain Zachariah Gillam and accompanied by Groseilliers, while the Eaglet was commanded by Captain William Stannard and accompanied by Radisson. On June 5, 1668, both ships left port at Deptford, England, but the Eaglet was forced to turn back off the coast of Ireland. After a successful trading expedition over the winter of 1668–1669, the Nonsuch returned to England.\n\"The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay\" was incorporated on May 2, 1670, with a Royal Charter from King Charles II. The charter granted the company a monopoly over the IndianĂ Trade, especially the fur trade, in the region watered by all rivers and streams flowing into Hudson Bay in northern Canada, an area known as Rupert's Land after the first director of the Company, Prince Rupert of the Rhine. This region constitutes 3.9 million km² (1.5 million square miles) in the watershed of Hudson Bay, comprising over one-third the area of modern-day Canada and stretching into the north central United States, but the specific boundaries were unknown at the time.\nRupert's Land, once controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company\nThe company founded its first headquarters at Fort Nelson at the mouth of the Nelson River in present-day northeastern Manitoba. The location afforded convenient access to the fort from the vast interior waterway systems of the Saskatchewan and Red rivers. Other posts were quickly established around the southern edge of Hudson Bay in Manitoba and present-day Ontario and Quebec. Called \"factories\", these posts operated in the manner of the Dutch fur trading operations in New Netherland.\nDuring the spring and summer First Nations traders, who did the vast majority of the trapping itself, travelled by canoe and were received at the fort to sell their pelts. In exchange they typically received metal tools and hunting gear, often imported by the company from Germany, the centre of inexpensive manufacturing in that era. Alcohol became another payment mechanism. Native addiction to alcohol became another inducement to fur trading, with their lack of European cultural history of being innured to it and which may be related, as some claim, to a lack of a form of biological resistance to extreme drunkneness that could be exploited.\nThe early coastal factory model contrasted with the system of the French, who established an extensive system of inland posts and sent traders to live among the tribes of the region. The conservative nature of the English company's more centralized factory system frustrated the company's founders, Radisson and Des Groseilliers, who urged bolder explorations of the continental interior. In 1674 they switched their allegiance back to France and in 1682 they founded La Compagnie du Nord to directly compete with the company. After war broke out in Europe between France and England in the 1680s, the two nations regularly sent expeditions to raid and capture each other's fur trading posts. In March 1686, the French sent a raiding party under Chevalier des Troyes over 1300 km (800 miles) to capture the company's posts along James Bay. The French appointed Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, who had shown extreme heroism during the raids, as commander of the company's captured posts. In 1697, d'Iberville commanded a French naval raid on the company's headquarters at York Factory. On the way to the fort, he defeated three ships of the Royal Navy in the Battle of the Bay, the largest naval battle in the history of the North American Arctic. D'Iberville's depleted French force captured York Factory by a ruse in which laid siege to fort while pretending to be a much larger army. York Factory changed hands several times in the next decade. It was finally ceded permanently to what was by then the Kingdom of Great Britain (following the union of Scotland and England in 1707) in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. After the treaty, the company rebuilt York Factory as a brick star fort at the mouth of the nearby Hayes River, its present location.\nA Hudson's Bay Company post on Lake Winnipeg, circa 1884\nIn its trade with native peoples, the company adopted the widespread use of issuing wool blankets, called Hudson's Bay point blankets, in exchange for the beaver pelts trapped by native hunters.\nIn 1821, the North West Company of Montréal and the Hudson's Bay Company merged, with a combined territory that was extended by a licence to the North-Western Territory, which reached to the Arctic Ocean on the north and the Pacific Ocean on the west. Although the HBC maintained a monopoly on the fur trade during the early-mid 19th century there was competition from James Sinclair and Andrew McDermot (Dermott), independent traders in the Red River Colony.\nOne major event that lead to the demise of the HBC's monopoly in Rupert's Land was the Guillaume Sayer Trial in 1849. Sayer, a Métis trapper and trader, was accused of the illegal trading of furs and brought to trial by the Court of Assiniboia, which was heavily stacked with either HBC officals or HBC supporters. During the trial, a crowd of armed Métis men led by Louis Riel Sr. gathered outside the courtroom, ready to support their Métis brother peacefully or by force if necessary. Although found guilty of illegal trade by Judge Adam Thom, no fine or punishment was levied - many reports state it was due to the intimidating crowd gathered outside the courthouse. With the cry, \"Le commerce est libre! Le commerce est libre!\" (\"Free Trade! Free Trade!\"), the HBC no longer could use the courts to enforce their monopoly on the settlers of Red River. In 1870 the trade monopoly was abolished and trade in the region was opened to any entrepreneur. The company relinquished its ownership of Rupert's Land under the Rupert's Land Act of 1868 enacted by the Parliament of the newly formed Dominion of Canada.\nThroughout the 1820s and 1830s the company controlled nearly all trading operations in the Oregon Country, based out of the company headquarters at Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River. Although authority over the region was nomially shared by the U.S. and Britain through the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, company policy, enforced through Chief John McLoughlin of the company's Columbia District, was to actively discourage U.S. settlement of the territory. The company's effective monopoly on trade virtually forbade any settlement in the region. In the early 1840s it established an outpost at Fort Hall in present-day southeastern Idaho along the route of the Oregon Trail, where the outpost director displayed the abandoned wagons of discouraged settlers to those seeking to move west along the trail. The company's stranglehold on the region was broken by the first successful large wagon train to reach Oregon in 1843, led by Marcus Whitman. In the years that followed, thousands of emigrants were pouring into the Willamette Valley and in 1846 the U.S. acquired full authority of the most settled areas of the Oregon Country south of the 49th parallel. McLoughlin, who had once turned away would-be settlers as company director, now welcomed them from his general store at Oregon City and was later proclaimed the \"Father of Oregon\". The company retains no presence in the Pacific Northwest of the United States today.\nOne aspect of the company's operations was the Hudson's Bay Company Stores, trading posts that were established across northern Canada. Today, this is the only part of the company operation remaining, in the form of department stores under the name The Bay. Many Hudson's Bay Company stores were, until quite recently, the only stores in remote towns. More recently, stores in major downtown locations have been transformed into boutiques.\nToday there are three main retail divisions: The Bay, Zellers, and Home Outfitters. In addition, there is a chain of 105 smaller Fields general merchandise and apparel stores that the company operates in Western Canada. Northern Stores are no longer operated by HBC, but by a corporation organized in 1987 under the name The North West Company. Simpson's department stores which were acquired by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1979 were converted to The Bay stores in 1991. In the 1970s and 1980s, HBC operated a chain of catalogue stores under the name Shop-Rite. In these stores, little merchandise was displayed openly: customers made their selections from catalogues, and staff would retrieve the merchandise from store-rooms. This form of retailing, now largely disappeared, was referred to as \"catalogue showroom\".\nIn 1991, the Bay agreed to stop selling fur in response to complaints from people opposed to killing animals for this purpose. However, in 1997, the Bay reopened its fur salons to meet the demand of consumers desiring to buy fur. Animal rights groups such as Freedom for Animals have been campaigning to get the Bay to once again stop selling fur.\nThe Hudson's Bay Company building in Montreal\nIn December of 2003, Maple Leaf Heritage Investments, a Nova Scotia-based company that was created to acquire shares of Hudson's Bay Company, announced that it was considering making an offer to acquire all or some of the common shares of Hudson's Bay Company. Maple Leaf Heritage Investments is a subsidiary of B-Bay Inc., whose CEO and chairman is American businessman, Jerry Zucker, the head of The InterTech Group Inc., a conglomerate that is the second-largest private firm in the State of South Carolina. (Note: this is not Jerry Zucker, the Hollywood producer.)\nOn August 13, 2004, a report in the Globe and Mail suggested that part or all of HBC may be purchased by the American Target chain. Such rumours have been raised before and have never come to fruition.\nOn March 2, 2005, the company was announced as the new clothing outfitter for the Canadian Olympic team. The $100 million deal means that the Bay will provide clothing for the 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 games.\nThe legacy of the HBC has been maintained in part by the detailed record-keeping and archiving of material by the Company. Prior to 1974, the records of the HBC were kept in the London office headquarters. The HBC opened an Archives department to researchers in 1931. In 1974, the Hudson's Bay Company Archives were transferred from London, and deposited in the Manitoba Archives in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The collection was opened to public access in 1975.\nIn 1994, the HBC donated the Company records to the Province of Manitoba. The appraised value of the records was nearly $60 million. A foundation, funded through the tax savings resulting from the donation, was established to support the operations of the HBCA as a division of the Archives of Manitoba, along with other activities and programs. There are more than two kilometres of documents as well as hundreds of microfilm reels now stored in a special climate-controlled vault in the Manitoba Archives Building."

We want to hear from you!\nHistory\nFur Trade\nFor nearly 250 years, from the early 17th to the mid-19th centuries, the fur trade was a vast commercial enterprise across the wild, forested expanse of what is now Canada.\nFor nearly 250 years, from the early 17th to the mid-19th centuries, the fur trade was a vast commercial enterprise across the wild, forested expanse of what is now Canada. Sustained primarily by the trapping of beavers to satisfy the European demand for felt hats, the intensely competitive trade opened the continent to exploration and settlement, financed missionary work, established social, economic and colonial relationships between Europeans and Indigenous people , and played a formative role in the creation of Canada.\nFishing, Furs and Christianity: Early Euro-Indigenous Relations\nThe fur trade began as an adjunct to the fishing industry. Early in the 16th century fishermen from northwest Europe were taking rich catches of cod on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland and in the Gulf of St Lawrence (see History of Commercial Fisheries ). Drying their fish onshore took several weeks, during which time good relations had to be maintained with Indigenous people, who were eager to obtain metal and cloth goods from the Europeans. What they had to offer in exchange were furs and fresh meat. The fishermen found an eager market in Europe for the furs and made high profits.\nWhen the wide-brimmed felt hat came into fashion later in the 16th century, the demand for beaver pelts increased tremendously. The best material for hat felt was the soft underfur of the beaver, the strands of which had tiny barbs that made them mat together tightly.\nThe first French traders established permanent shore bases in Acadia , a post at Tadoussac , and in 1608, a base at Québec to exploit the trade more effectively. The following year, the Dutch began trading up the Hudson River and in 1614 established permanent trading posts at Manhattan and upriver at Orange (what is now Albany, New York). This activity marked the beginning of intense rivalry between two commercial empires, and between their respective Indigenous allies, the Huron-Wendat and the Haudenosaunee , both of whom were supplied with guns by their European allies.\nIndigenous peoples were important partners in this growing fur trade economy. From roughly 1600 to 1650, the French forged alliances of kinship and trade with the Huron-Wendat , Algonquin and Innu . These peoples helped the French to collect and process beaver furs, and distribute them to other Indigenous groups throughout their vast trade network, which was established well before the arrival of Europeans to North America. The fur trade provided Indigenous peoples with European goods that they could use for gift-giving ceremonies, to improve their social status and to go to war. The French forged military alliances with their Indigenous allies in order to maintain good trade and social relations; in the 17th century, they fought against the Haudenosaunee in the struggle for control over resources, known as the Beaver Wars or the French and Iroquois Wars.\nDuring  the first half of the 17th century, the number of traders flooding into the St Lawrence River region, and cutthroat competition among them, greatly reduced profits. In an attempt to impose order, the French Crown granted monopolies of the trade to certain individuals. In return, the monopoly holders had to maintain French claims to the new lands and assist in the attempts of the Roman Catholic Church to convert Indigenous people to Christianity .\nIn 1627, Cardinal Richelieu, first minister of Louis XIII, organized the Compagnie des Cent-Associés to put French territorial claims and the missionary drive on a firmer footing. Missionaries were sent out: in 1615, four Récollets, and in 1625 the first members of the powerful Society of Jesus ( Jesuits ), arrived at Québec. A mission base, Ste Marie Among the Hurons , was established among the Huron -Wendat near Georgian Bay, but the Huron-Wendat were more interested in the trade goods of the French than in their religion. And it was fur-trade profits that sustained the missionaries and allowed the company to send hundreds of settlers to the colony. In 1642 Ville-Marie [Montréal] was founded as a mission centre. In 1645, the company ceded control of the fur trade and the colony's administration to the colonists. (See Communauté des habitants ). Unfortunately, they proved to be inept administrators, and fur-trade returns fluctuated wildly. Finally, after a desperate appeal by the colonial authorities to Louis XIV, in 1663 the Crown took over the colony.\nFrench Control and French Profits\nThe main staple of the trade was still beaver for the hat industry. The Ministry of Marine (see Ministère de la Marine ), responsible for colonial affairs, leased three overseas enterprises -- the West Indies plantation trade, the African slave trade, and the marketing of Canadian beaver and moose hides -- to the newly formed Compagnie des Indes occidentales , which was in reality a crown corporation. All permanent residents of New France were permitted to trade for furs with Indigenous people, but they had to sell the beaver and moose hides to the company at prices fixed by the Ministry of Marine. All other furs were traded on a free market; thus the trade was not a monopoly, but the law of supply and demand had been suspended for beaver and moose hides.\nJean-Baptiste Colbert, the French minister of marine, hoped to see the Canadian economy diversified to produce raw materials for French industry, particularly timber, and minerals and foodstuffs for the West Indies plantations. Thousands of emigrants were shipped to Canada at the Crown's expense to bring the land into production.\nColbert discovered that a sizable proportion of the young men did not remain on the land but disappeared for years to trade with Indigenous people in distant villages (see Coureurs de bois ). The main reasons for this phenomenon were the assured profits in the trade and the imbalance of the sexes in the colony, which was so great that until about 1710, only about one man in seven could hope to find a wife -- a necessity on a farm. In the interior, however, the traders quickly formed alliances with Indigenous women, whose economic skills helped the French adapt to wilderness life. Women made clothing and moccasins and helped to supply the fur trade posts. Most importantly, they fostered kinship ties between Europeans and Indigenous peoples, linking the two groups in more than just trade and economy.\nBy 1681, Colbert was forced to acknowledge the pull of the fur trade, and he inaugurated the congé system. Each year up to 25 congés (licences to trade) were to be issued by the governor. Each congé allowed three men with one canoe to trade in the West. It was hoped that the Canadians would wait their turn for a congé, thus leaving the colony only 75 men short each year. But the new system did little to reduce the number of men away from the settlements (most of them illegally), and the amount of beaver pouring into Montréal continued to increase astronomically. By the 1690s the Domaine de l'Occident (Company of the Farm), which had been obliged to take over the beaver trade in 1674 from the defunct Compagnie des Indes occidentales, was complaining of a huge glut. In 1696, in desperation, the minister of marine gave orders to suspend the beaver trade, to stop the issuing of congés, and to abandon all the French posts in the West, except Saint-Louis-des-Illinois.\nWar and Rivalry: France, England and Indigenous People\nThe order to abandon the western trading posts (to slow the migration of men into the beaver trade, and to reduce the glut of pelts) was given while England and France were at war and the Canadians were engaged in a desperate struggle with the English colonies and their Haudenosaunee allies. The governor and intendant (French administrator) in Québec protested vigorously, declaring that to abandon the posts in the West meant abandoning their Indigenous allies, who, by the latter half of the 17th century included also the Saulteaux ( Ojibwa ), Potawatomi and Choctaw. The French feared that these peoples would  become allies of the English. New France would be doomed.\nIn addition, the English had been established since 1670 at posts on the sub-Arctic coast of Hudson Bay (see Hudson's Bay Company [HBC]), and the western posts were essential to fend off that competition. The Canadian Compagnie du Nord had been founded in 1682 to challenge the HBC on its own ground, but it was a failure. The minister of marine was obliged to rescind his drastic orders and the beaver trade resumed in spite of the over-supply, for purely political reasons.\nIn 1700, on the eve of new hostilities, Louis XIV ordered the establishment of the new colony of Louisiana on the lower Mississippi River, plus settlements in the Illinois country and a garrisoned post at Detroit. The aim was to hem in the English colonies between the Allegheny Mountains and the Atlantic. This imperialist policy depended on the support of the First Nations.  In 1701, the French and their allies reached a truce with the Haudenosaunee, known as the Great Peace of Montréal . This effectively ended the Beaver Wars over the fur trade. By that time, however, the wars had already resulted in the permanent dispersal or destruction of several First Nations in the Eastern Woodlands , including the Huron-Wendat.\nVoyageurs\nIn 1715, it was discovered that rodents and insects had consumed the glut of beaver fur in French warehouses. The market immediately revived. As an item on the balance sheet of French external trade, furs were minuscule, and their share was shrinking proportionately as trade in tropical produce and manufactured goods increased; however, the fur trade was the backbone of the Canadian economy.\nUnlike the HBC with its monolithic structure staffed by paid servants, in New France the trade was carried on into the early 18th century by scores of small partnerships. As costs rose with distance, the trade came to be controlled by a small number of bourgeois , who hired hundreds of wage-earning voyageurs . Most companies consisted of three or four men who obtained from the authorities the lease on the trade at a specific post for three years; all members shared profits or losses proportional to the capital subscribed. Trade goods were usually obtained on credit, at 30 per cent interest, from a small number of Montréal merchants who also marketed the furs through their agents in France. The voyageurs' wages varied from 200 to 500 livres if they wintered in the West. For those who paddled the canoes westward in the spring and returned with the autumn convoy, the usual wage was 100-200 livres plus their keep (about double what a labourer or artisan would earn in the colony).\nWestward Expansion\nBetween 1715 and the Seven Years' War (1756-63) the fur trade expanded greatly and served a variety of purposes — economic, political and scientific. Educated Frenchmen were keenly interested in scientific inquiry, and government members, eager to discover the extent of North America, wished a Frenchman to be the first to find an overland route to the western sea (see Northwest Passage ). Commissions were granted to senior Canadian officers such as Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de La Vérendrye to discover that route. They were given command of vast western regions (some of which overlapped territory claimed by the British), with sole right to the fur trade. Out of their profits they had to pay the expenses of maintaining their posts and sending exploration parties west along the Missouri and Saskatchewan rivers.\nThe Crown thereby made the fur trade pay the costs of its pursuit of science, and also maintained control over both its subjects in the wilderness and its alliances with the First Nations in order to exclude the English. By 1756, when war with England put a stop to exploration , the French had reached the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Warfare between the Blackfoot and Cree prevented further advances.\nHudson's Bay Company and Other English Traders\nThroughout this period there was keen competition between the French Canadian traders and the HBC, with the Canadians taking the lion's share of the trade. They had many advantages: they controlled the main waterways throughout the West; they had a sure supply of the birch bark needed for canoes (something that the Anglo-Americans and the HBC men both lacked); many of their trade goods were preferred by the Indigenous people; and they had good relations with the First Nations, with whom they had developed extensive kinship ties. Attempts by the English of the Thirteen Colonies to obtain more land for settlement angered the Indigenous people. The French did not covet Indigenous lands, but were determined to deny them to the English.\nThe HBC traders made no real attempt to push their trade inland. Instead, they waited in their posts for Indigenous people to come to them. The First Nations were astute enough to play the English and French against each other by trading with both. The French dared not try to prevent Indigenous people from taking some furs to the Bay, but made sure to obtain the choice furs, leaving only the bulky, poor-quality ones to their rivals.\nIn the St Lawrence region, New York and Pennsylvania traders made little attempt to compete with the Canadians. Instead, they purchased furs clandestinely from the Montréal merchants. In this way the Canadians obtained a good supply of strouds (coarse English woollen cloth), a favourite English trade item. The illicit trade between Montréal and Albany also removed any incentive the New York traders might have had to compete with the Canadians in the West.\nWhen the Seven Years' War began, the fur trade continued out of Montréal. The First Nations people had to be kept supplied, but the volume of exported furs steadily declined. Within a year of the French capitulation at Montréal in September 1760 and the end of New France, the trade began to revive, largely supported by British capital and Canadian labour.\nRise of the North West Company\nAt the time of the Conquest , over the period 1759-60, two systems dominated the commercial fur trade of the northern half of the continent: the St Lawrence-Great Lakes system, based at Montréal and extending to the upper reaches of the Mississippi River and its major northern tributaries, as well as to the prairies and the southern portion of the Canadian Shield; and the Rupert's Land system, which theoretically covered the whole region draining into Hudson and James Bays.\nThe St Lawrence-Great Lakes system, developed by the French, had come to be served by the en dérouine (itinerant peddling) pattern of trade - in which the trade, dominated by many small partnerships, was conducted by parties of a few men sent out to do business with the First Nations in their own territory. The Rupert's Land trading system, by contrast, had not evolved in the same manner; in 1760 the HBC's employees still followed the practice of remaining in their coastal \"factories\" (major trading posts), awaiting the arrival of Indigenous people to trade.\nAfter the Conquest, Anglo-Americans (Yankees, or Bastonnais), and English and Highland Scots merchants supplanted the Canadian bourgeois and the agents of French merchants at Montréal. The new \"pedlars\" forged a new commercial link with London. The resulting upsurge in activity in Montreal disturbed the HBC's \"sleep by the frozen sea\": the success of its new rivals forced the company to alter its coast-factory trading policy, and in 1774 the HBC penetrated inland from the Bay to found Cumberland House , close to the Saskatchewan River. For their part, the pedlars learned that co-operation among themselves, rather than competition, was the road to commercial success.\nThe resulting North West Company (NWC) rose rapidly to a position of dominance by gaining a de facto monopoly of the trade in the fur-rich area around Lake Athabasca . Staple fur (beaver) and fancy furs (mink, marten, fisher, etc), unsurpassed in quality and number, assured handsome profits in spite of the high costs of the necessarily labour-intensive transportation system, the canoe brigade. The annual dash of brigades from Fort Chipewyan to Grand Portage (later to Fort William ) on Lake Superior created much of the romantic image of the fur trade. To maintain its Athabasca monopoly the NWC competed, at a loss if necessary, with its opponents on the Saskatchewan River, around Lake Winnipeg, and north of the Great Lakes. On the North Saskatchewan River, the rival companies leapfrogged westward past each other's posts in an attempt to gain a commercial advantage with First Nations.\nIn all regions, small trading parties journeyed with supplies of trade goods to waylay Indigenous people traveling to rivals' posts and, when necessary, to force them to trade. In this competition the HBC appeared disadvantaged in spite of its having a major shipment post, York Factory on Hudson Bay, much closer to the fur-gathering areas than was the NWC's trans-shipment point of Montréal.\nThe HBC lacked personnel and equipment equal to the tasks of inland travel and trade. Not until the 1790s did the HBC evolve the York Boat brigade as an answer to its rival's canot de maître and canot du nord. Even then, improved equipment and personnel were not sufficient to turn the commercial tide in the company's favour.\nMontréal agents such as Simon \"The Marquis\" McTavish and his nephew and successor William McGillivray shrewdly directed the NWC's affairs, but much of the company's success was due to the élan of its officers and employees (engagés). Wintering partners participated in decision making and enjoyed the profits of the trade. Unlike the HBC, the NWC’s acceptance of intermarriage between traders and Indigenous wives  resulted in a certain stability. The mixed-descent children of these “country marriages” — known as the Métis people — established themselves as traders, buffalo hunters and suppliers to the NWC. By the early 19th century,  sizeable Métis populations existed around trade posts, and especially in the Red River Colony .\nIn 1789 Alexander Mackenzie carried the NWC's flag to the Arctic Ocean, and in 1793 he reached the Pacific Ocean overland. Later explorers such as Simon Fraser and David Thompson opened up the fur lands west of the Rocky Mountains. The signing of Jay's Treaty in 1794 ended the southwest trade, and a new rival, the XY Company , appeared in 1798. But the NWC met its challenge and in 1804 absorbed this upstart.\nHudson's Bay Company Triumphs\nIt was the revitalization of the HBC beginning in 1810 that ultimately defeated the NWC. That year, the Earl of Selkirk 's decision to establish a settlement in HBC territory led him to purchase sufficient stock to place four friends on the HBC's seven-man governing committee. These men, new to the company, emphasized efficiency in the trading process as the means to reduce costs and turn from loss to profit. Success in this endeavour led the company to attempt to invade the Athabasca country in 1815. Poor planning by the expedition's leader and the NWC's influence with the Indigenous people in the region caused as many as 15 men to die of starvation. But the HBC, undaunted, returned a few months later and successfully challenged the NWC monopoly.\nThe governing committee gave Selkirk's Red River Colony assistance and co-operation, although officers in the region were unenthusiastic. The NWC saw the settlers as supporters of their newly revitalized commercial rival, and convinced the local Métis, who had settled the region earlier, that their lands were threatened. Commercial conflict erupted in violence when the colony's governor and some 20 other settlers and HBC servants died in the Seven Oaks incident on 19 June 1816; the Métis lost only one man.\nSuch occurrences led the British government to demand that the competing fur companies resolve their differences. To this end the government passed legislation enabling it to offer an exclusive licence to trade for 21 years in those areas of British North America beyond settlement and outside Rupert's Land. In 1821 the two companies created the \"Deed Poll,\" a document which outlined the terms of a coalition between them, detailed the sharing of the profits of the trade between the shareholders and individual officers in the field, and explained their relationship in the management of the trade. It was in this manner as well as in the sharing of profits that elements of the NWC survived in the new HBC, although what was a coalition in name became absorption by the HBC in fact when, in 1824, the board of management was eliminated. A majority of officers working for the HBC after 1821 were former Nor'Westers.\nSimpson Consolidates Fur Trade Empire\nCommercial agreements between the two separate companies and the support given by government legislation and proclamation could not hide the NWC's defeat. The victorious HBC once again sought to increase its efficiency. Under the direction of Governor George Simpson , the \"Little Emperor,\" the HBC achieved undreamed-of profits. But such profits required a constant monitoring of costs and a constant search for savings, as well as a policy of sharp competition with rivals in border areas. Through the company's policies and the actions of its personnel, the inhabitants of the old North-West were exposed to the influence of changes wrought in Britain by the Industrial Revolution, including the creation of workforces dependent on company employment.\nSimpson clearly saw the importance of providing support to Indigenous people's hunting and trapping – which supplied the furs that sustained the HBC's fortunes. In times of adversity the company offered medical services and sufficient supplies and provisions for the trapper and his family to survive. Yet in systematizing these services Simpson's policies led Indigenous people into an increasingly dependent relationship with the HBC. The Plains Indigenous people, while the buffalo hunt was still possible, could be independent of the company's services, but for others the new reality was increasingly economic dependence.\nSimpson's reforms allowed HBC expansion along the Pacific coast, northward to the Arctic, and into the interior of Labrador, which had been largely ignored until then. Such a vast fur domain attracted rivals. Simpson's fundamental strategy was to meet competition in the frontier areas to preserve the trade of the interior for the HBC. On the Pacific coast he reached an agreement with the Russian Fur Company permitting the HBC to pursue the maritime trade and successfully challenge the pre-eminence of the Americans. South and east of the Columbia River, he encouraged expeditions to trap the region clean in a \"scorched-earth\" policy that left no animals to attract American \"mountain men\" or trappers. In the Great Lakes area he licensed small traders to carry competition to the territory of the American Fur Company, eventually causing it to abandon the field for an annual payment of £300.\nFarther east, the opponents were more difficult to dislodge. The King's Posts , a series of posts north of the St Lawrence originally belonging to the French king, had been granted in 1822 to a Mr. Goudie of Québec City; and along the Ottawa River, lumbering provided bases for competition to arise. Yet the company vigorously pursued its competitors in all the frontier areas, sustaining its monopoly of the trade in Rupert's Land and in the licensed territories to the north and west. Even when, in the 1830s, silk replaced felt as the favoured raw material in the manufacture of hats and beaver lost its value as a staple fur, the company maintained a profitable trade emphasizing fancy fur. Instead, it was settlement, not commercial rivals, that presented the biggest challenge to the company.\nChallenge of Settlement and End of the Trade\nWest of the Rocky Mountains, American settlers succeeded where their predecessors, the mountain men and the ships' captains, had failed. As a result of the Oregon Treaty of 1846 the HBC retreated north of the 49th parallel of latitude. To the east, at Red River, the HBC met the challenge of free traders by charging Guillaume Sayer and three other Métis in 1849 with violation of the HBC monopoly. Although the company won a legal victory in the courtroom, the community believed that the free traders had been exonerated. In Lower Canada the company acquired the lease for the King's Posts in 1832, but the northward march of lumbermen signalled the lessening importance of the fur trade in this region. Simpson countered brilliantly by making his company an important supplier of goods needed by the lumber crews.\nWhen the geographical isolation of the West was breached in the 1840s, forces other than the fur interests became involved in opening the \"Great Lone Land.\" Roman Catholic and Anglican missionaries who had appeared earlier now penetrated to the heart of the continent. They were followed by adventurers and government expeditions (see the Palliser Expedition ) seeking resources other than fur: timber, territory, and scientific knowledge. Simpson's death in 1860 and the sale in 1863 of the HBC to the International Financial Society, a British investment group that saw settlement as a source of profits, marked the beginning of the end of the historic fur trade.\nIn 1870 the HBC's vast territory in the West was transferred to Canada. The year after, the federal government began signing treaties with the Indigenous peoples of the area, thereby acquiring title to those traditional lands and opening them up to settlement and development (see Numbered Treaties ). What had been a trickle of settlers coming from Ontario now became a flood. As settlement spread north and west, the HBC and rival free traders intensified the northward push of the trade, and eventually established enduring trading contacts with the Inuit . Fur traders moved into the arctic territories of whalers, who had abandoned their posts as the whaling economy declined. From 1912 to the early 1930s, the HBC established a series of trading posts in the arctic.\nIn the face of competition and the presence of the Canadian government, the HBC reduced the support services that had been a part of its trading relationship with the First Nations and had buffered Indigenous people against the swings of fur-market demands in western Europe. In the 20th century, fortunes in the fur trade came to reflect the swings of the market and the advent of fur farming (see Fur Industry ). Increasingly Indigenous people looked to the missions and even more to the government for support in times of adversity. This shift culminated in the granting of family allowance, schooling and pensions after the Second World War, and marked the end of the historic fur trade. Fur trapping continues as a cash crop in frontier areas, but as a way of life it is confined to a few northern areas.\nHistorically, the fur trade played a singular role in the development of Canada. It provided the motive for the exploration of much of the country and remained the economic foundation for western Canada until about 1870. The fur trade also determined the relatively peaceful patterns of Indigenous-European relations in Canada. A central social aspect of this economic enterprise was extensive intermarriage between traders and Indigenous women, which gave rise to an indigenous fur-trade society that blended Indigenous and European customs and attitudes."

    "content": "CANADA - Canadian history\nWelcome         to the Canadian Information pages\n \nHISTORY\nCanada and the United         States have many major geographic features in common.         They share the Rocky Mountains, the Interior Plains, four         of the Great Lakes, the Appalachian Highlands, and many         rivers. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the         stories of the exploration and settlement of both of         these nations are closely interwoven.\nThe complete         history of neither Canada nor the United States can be         studied without reference to the history of the other.         Each is today an independent nation. Each, however,         achieved its independence by a completely different         path--Canada by gradual constitutional change spread over         many years, the United States by a single great War of         Independence.\nDiscovery of Canada\nThe earliest         discovery of the New World was made by Norse seafarers         known as Vikings. The vague accounts of their exploits         are drawn from their sagas, epic stories in prose or         verse handed down by word of mouth through many         generations. In AD 985 Norse seamen sailing from Iceland         to Greenland were blown far westward off their course and         sighted the coast of what must have been Labrador. The         report of forested areas on the strange new coast         encouraged further explorations by Norse colonists from         Greenland, whose settlements lacked lumber.\nIn AD 1000 Leif         Ericson became the first European to land in North         America (see Ericson). According to the sagas,         this was the first of many Norse voyages to the eastern         shores of the continent. A colony was established in what         the Vikings described as Vinland, identified in 1963 as         being on the northernmost tip of Newfoundland. Recent         investigations have cast doubt on the once-popular theory         that the Vikings also penetrated Hudson Bay and reached         the upper Great Lakes region by overland routes.         Discoveries of \"Norse\" relics in that area have         been exposed by scholars as hoaxes. The Greenland colony         died out during the 14th and 15th centuries, and the         Norse adventures in Canada must have come to an end well         before that time.\nRediscovery and         Exploration\nIn 1497 an         Italian named John Cabot sailed west from Bristol,         England, intent on finding a new trade route to the         Orient for his patron, King Henry VII of England (see Cabot). This voyage led to the rediscovery of the eastern         shores of Canada. Cabot was as confident as Columbus had         been that a new seaway was now open to Asia. On a second         voyage, the following year, Cabot explored the coast of         North America, touching at various points--none too         clearly charted--from Baffin Island to Maryland. The         Cabot voyages gave England a claim by right of discovery         to an indefinite area of eastern North America. Its later         claims to Newfoundland, Cape Breton Island, and         neighboring regions were at least partly based on Cabot's         exploits.\nOf more         immediate significance were the explorer's reports of         immensely rich fishing waters. The Roman Catholic         countries of Western Europe furnished a market that made         the ocean voyage worthwhile, even if it were made to         gather the harvest of the sea instead of the spices and         jewels of the Orient. Almost every year after 1497 an         international mixture of fishing vessels could be seen on         the offshore fisheries southeast of Newfoundland and east         of Nova Scotia. Occasionally such ships even cruised into         the Gulf of St. Lawrence. At times their crews         encountered Indians along the shores who were willing to         part with valuable furs in exchange for articles of         little worth such as beads and other trinkets.\nWhen it was         realized that only the wilds of an unexplored new world         had been discovered, there was a spirit of         disillusionment in Europe. Gradually, however, this         feeling was replaced by a fresh interest in North         America, for Spanish and Portuguese adventurers were         reported to be bringing home rich cargoes of gold and         silver from the Caribbean. In 1524 King Francis I of         France sent a Florentine navigator, Giovanni da         Verrazano, on a voyage of reconnaissance overseas.         Verrazano explored the eastern coastline of North America         from North Carolina to Newfoundland, giving France too         some claim to the continent by right of discovery. (See         also America, Discovery and Colonization of.)\nCartier's Explorations\nTen years later         Francis I followed up the work of Verrazano by         dispatching an expedition under Jacques Cartier (see Cartier). On his voyage of 1534 Cartier sailed a route         that was for the most part already well known. This was         an official exploring expedition, however, and its         immediate result was a thorough report for the French         king about the lands he had seen and the people he had         met. He visited and named most of the important coasts on         the Gulf of St. Lawrence and observed near Anticosti         Island that he might be in the mouth of a great river.\nThe first known         penetration of the interior through the St. Lawrence         River gateway took place the following year, when Cartier         returned as leader of a new expedition. Pressing upstream         in three small vessels, he reached the Indian village of         Stadacona, near the present site of the city of Quebec. A         little more than 150 miles farther upstream he reached         the end of navigation at a large island in the river.         Here he found another Indian village, called Hochelaga,         on the site of the present city of Montreal. From the         height behind it, to which he gave the name Mont Real, he         could see the foaming Lachine Rapids blocking the way to         the upper waters of the St. Lawrence. At Stadacona,         Cartier and his followers passed a bitter winter. Many of         his party died from cold and scurvy before he could set         sail for France the following spring.\nEnd of the First         Colonizing Effort\n \nIn 1541 Cartier         led his third, and probably his last, expedition to the         St. Lawrence. A new headquarters was established at         Cap-Rouge, a few miles upstream from Stadacona. This time         Cartier was to be followed by Jean Francois de la Rocque,         sieur de Roberval, with a party of colonists. After a         wait which lasted through the following winter, Cartier         set sail for home, only to meet Roberval's party \"in         three tall ships\" in the harbor of what is now St.         John's, Newf.\nDisregarding the         orders of Roberval, who was his senior officer, to         accompany the colonizing party back to Quebec, Cartier         sailed for France under cover of darkness. The Roberval         expedition proceeded upstream, and a tragically         unsuccessful effort was made to found a permanent colony         on the site where Cartier had wintered the previous         season. By the following year some 60 of the colonists         had died. Roberval decided to abandon the whole         colonizing project, and France itself turned its back on         the Canadian experiment for almost 60 years.\nThe Founding of New         France\nThroughout the         rest of the 16th century the European fishing fleets         continued to make almost annual visits to the eastern         shores of Canada. Chiefly as a sideline of the fishing         industry, there continued an unorganized traffic in furs.         At home in Europe new methods of processing furs were         developed and beaver hats in particular grew very         fashionable. Thus new encouragement was given to the         infant fur trade in Canada. In 1598 Troilus de Mesgouez,         marquis de la Roche, set out for Canada armed with a new         kind of authority--a royal monopoly which gave him the         exclusive right to trade in furs.\nLa Roche         established a small colony on Sable Island, an isolated         Atlantic sandbar southeast of Nova Scotia. The         settlement, which proved a dismal failure, was the first         of a series of efforts by France to persuade various         leaders to set up colonies in Canada in return for an         official monopoly of the fur trade. Pierre Chauvin in         1600 established a trading post at Tadoussac, on the St.         Lawrence River. This post survived for about three years.\nIn 1604 the fur         monopoly was granted to Pierre du Guast, sieur de Monts.         He led his first colonizing expedition to an island         located near the mouth of the St. Croix River. This in         time was to mark the international boundary between the         province of New Brunswick and the state of Maine. Among         his lieutenants was a geographer named Samuel de         Champlain, who promptly carried out a major exploration         of the northeastern coastline of what is now the United         States (see Champlain). In the spring the St.         Croix settlement was moved to a new site across the Bay         of Fundy, on the shore of the Annapolis Basin, an inlet         in western Nova Scotia.\nHere at Port         Royal in 1605 a settlement Champlain described as the         Habitation was established. It was France's most         successful colony to date. The land came to be known as         Acadia (see Acadia).\nThe Father of New         France\nThe cancellation         of De Monts's fur monopoly in 1607 brought the Port Royal         settlement to a temporary end. Champlain persuaded his         leader to allow him to take colonists and \"go and         settle on the great River St. Lawrence, with which I was         familiar through a voyage that I had made there.\" In         1608 he founded France's first permanent Canadian colony.         It was at Quebec, at the foot of a great rocky cape on         the north shore, which formed a natural fortress barring         the way upstream to the interior.\nThe early years         of the Quebec colony were hard, and the population grew         slowly. Champlain administered its affairs and took         personal charge of an organized exploration of the         unknown interior. Where he did not actually travel         himself, he sent other men. One was Etienne Brule, the         first white man to cross Pennsylvania and later the first         to see Lake Superior. Champlain himself discovered Lake         Champlain (1609); and in 1615 he journeyed by canoe up         the Ottawa, through Lake Nipissing, and down Georgian Bay         to the heart of the Huron country, near Lake Simcoe.         During these journeys Champlain aided the Hurons in         battles against the Iroquois Confederacy. As a result,         the Iroquois became mortal enemies of the French.\nIn 1629         Champlain suffered the humiliation of having to surrender         his almost starving garrison to an English fleet that         appeared before Quebec. He was taken to England as a         prisoner. Peace, however, had been declared between         England and France before the surrender, and New France         was accordingly restored to the French. Champlain         returned from Europe to spend his few remaining years. He         became governor of New France in 1633.\nFor the Glory of God\nNew France         continued to grow slowly. The fur trade served both to         keep alive an interest in the territory and at the same         time to discourage the development of agriculture, the         surest foundation of a colony in the New World. Settlers         founded Trois-Rivieres, farther up the St. Lawrence, in         1634.\nThe most distant         outpost for many years was Montreal, founded by Paul de         Chomedy, sieur de Maisonneuve, on May 18, 1642. First         known as Ville-Marie, this settlement, one day to become         Canada's largest city, was begun as a mission post. One         of the most famous of the leaders who accompanied         Maisonneuve was Jeanne Mance, founder of the Hotel-Dieu,         the first hospital at Ville-Marie.\nThe establishing         of Montreal was part of a large Canadian missionary         movement which was based in France. The work and         self-sacrifice of the Christian missionaries in the young         colony and in the wilds that lay beyond it is one of the         most stirring chapters in the history of New France.         During the 40 years following the founding of Quebec, a         dozen mission posts were built in the Huron country south         of Georgian Bay.\nThe Hurons lived         under constant threat of attack by the other Iroquois         tribes dwelling south and east of Lake Ontario. Suddenly,         in 1648, the Iroquois launched their final invasion of         Huronia. Several brave Jesuit priests died as martyrs,         and within a year both the Hurons and the missionaries         had been either wiped out or driven elsewhere.\nThe Iroquois         menace continued as one of the great obstacles to the         expansion of settlement. The history of New France         contains many accounts of heroism on the part of         soldiers, settlers, and missionaries during this long         guerrilla warfare on the outskirts of the colony. In 1660         Adam Dollard des Ormeaux led a small band of men in a         stand to the death against an Iroquois war party which         was on its way to destroy the settlement at Montreal.         When they had counted the losses they suffered at the         hands of so few Frenchmen, the Indians abandoned their         plans. As late as 1692, 14-year-old Marie-Madeleine de         Vercheres with only five companions defended her father's         fort for two days against marauding Iroquois until help         arrived.\nSeigneur and Habitant\nThe feudal         system of landholding, which had long been established in         France, was adopted in the colony. The nobles, in this         case the seigneurs, were granted lands and titles by the         king in return for their oath of loyalty and promise to         support him in time of war. The seigneur in turn granted         rights to work farm plots on his land to his vassals, or         habitants. In exchange, the habitants were required to         pay certain feudal dues each year, to work for the         seigneur for a given number of days annually, and to have         their grain ground in the seigneurial mill.\nIn         underpopulated New France the habitants welcomed the fact         that the seigneur was obligated to build a mill. They had         no military duties to perform except their common defense         against the Indians. There was little money and not much         use for it; and so the taxes took the form of payments in         chickens, geese, or other farm products. These         obligations were hardly burdensome. The seigneurs were         anxious that their habitants should wish to stay farmers,         and there was as much land as anyone could till.\nGovernor, Intendant,         and Bishop\nAs in France,         there was nothing resembling a democratic system of         government in the colony. The senior official was the         governor, appointed by the king. In the exercise of his         almost absolute power he felt more responsible to the         king in France than to the people he governed.\nAnother post of         French officialdom was established in Canada in 1665 with         the appointment of an intendant, whose chief         duties concerned finance and the administration of         justice. However, there was sufficient overlapping of         authority between governor and intendant to breed more         jealousy than cooperation between the two offices.\nJean Talon, who         had come to New France as intendant in 1665, brought         about a rapid expansion of the colony. He encouraged         agriculture, business, crafts, and exploration and         stimulated immigration. Under his direction, a census of         New France was taken in 1666, which showed a population         of 3,215. By that time the English controlled ten         colonies on the Atlantic coast to the south, and they had         greatly exceeded New France in population and         self-sufficiency (see America, Discovery and         Colonization of).\nIn 1672 Count         Louis de Frontenac arrived in the colony as governor (see Frontenac). He built a fort at Cataraqui, near         present-day Kingston, and brought the Iroquois into an         enforced peace. He directed a series of major exploratory         voyages to the interior. Among the greatest explorations         were those made by Louis Jolliet, Father Jacques         Marquette, and Rene Cavelier, sieur de La Salle. By 1682,         however, the troubles between Frontenac and the         intendant, Jacques Duchesneau, had become so serious that         the king recalled both governor and intendant. (See         also Jolliet; La Salle; Marquette.)\nFrontenac was         sent out as governor again in 1689, just after a new war         had broken out between France and England. He carried the         fighting right into the English colonies, dispatching         expeditions overland against the settlements to the south         in the dead of winter. When Sir William Phips led a         British fleet upstream to Quebec in 1690, the fiery old         French governor haughtily refused the demand for         surrender, saying to the emissary of the English         commander, \"I will answer your general by the mouths         of my cannon!\"\nIn 1674, with         the elevation of the vicar apostolic, Francois Xavier de         Laval-Montmorency, to the rank of bishop, a new and         powerful office was created at the head of the clergy in         New France. Laval organized the parish system in the         colony, gave encouragement to the missionaries, and         founded Quebec Seminary for the training of young men for         the priesthood. He resigned his office in 1684 but spent         the last 20 years of his life in the seminary he had         established in Quebec.\nFrench and English         Rivalry\nWhile the         English colonies were growing rapidly along the Atlantic         seaboard, French fur traders and explorers were extending         long but thinly supported strands of ownership deep into         the heart of North America. La Salle's exploration of the         Mississippi to its mouth in 1682 gave France a claim to a         vast area bordering the American Colonies from the Great         Lakes and the Ohio River valley southward to the Gulf of         Mexico. It could be only a matter of time before the         rivalries between France and England elsewhere in the         world would be sharply reflected in a final struggle for         the ownership of the North American continent. England's         concern over France's threatened control of much more         than half the continent began as early as Henry Hudson's         last voyage, in the time of Champlain (see Hudson,         Henry), and the probings for the Northwest Passage by         such explorers as Sir Martin Frobisher, John Davis, and         William Baffin.\nEngland came to         realize that the easiest riches of the New World were to         be found in furs rather than in gold. Thus it was quick         to follow up its claim to the back-door route to the fur         country by founding the Hudson's Bay Company in 1670, on         the suggestion of Pierre Esprit de Radisson and Medart         Chouart, sieur de Groseilliers (see Fur Trade,         History of the).\nFor many years         England's domination of Hudson Bay was threatened by the         French. In 1686 Pierre Troyes led an amazing overland         expedition from Montreal to the shores of the bay, where         his followers succeeded in capturing a number of the         company forts by surprise. In his party was one of the         most daring and brilliant leaders in the history of New         France, Pierre le Moyne, sieur d'Iberville. Iberville         commanded a series of naval raids into the bay during the         next few years and almost succeeded in driving the         English from this part of the continent altogether. (See         also Iberville.)\nA fresh struggle         between France and England, known as Queen Anne's War,         broke out in 1702 and led to the capture of Port Royal by         the English in 1710 (see Queen Anne's War). The         Treaty of Utrecht, which reestablished peace in 1713,         required France to surrender the Hudson Bay Territory,         Newfoundland, and Acadia. France was permitted to keep         Cape Breton Island as well as her inland colonies.\nAs an immediate         result of this setback, France founded the powerful         Fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island. It was to         serve as a year-round military and naval base for         France's remaining North American empire and also to         protect the entrance to the St. Lawrence River.         Louisbourg was developed into the most heavily fortified         bastion in North America during the next 25 years.\nIn 1745 an army         of New Englanders led by Sir William Pepperell mounted an         expedition of 90 vessels and 4,000 men against         Louisbourg. The fortress had become a hornet's nest of         raiders who preyed on the merchant ships of the American         Colonies. Within three months the New Englanders         succeeded in forcing Louisbourg to surrender. The         fortress was returned to France, however, by the Treaty         of Aix-la Chapelle signed in 1748. (See also King         George's War.)\nTo         counterbalance the renewed threat from Louisbourg,         England set up an Atlantic bastion of its own. In 1749 a         fleet bearing more than 2,500 new settlers from the         British Isles began the construction of the city of         Halifax.\nThe Final Struggle for         the Continent\nPeace between         the two rival powers did not last long. Fresh fighting         broke out in the New World even before the beginning of         the Seven Years' War in Europe (1756-63). As early as         1754 an expedition was sent against French-held Fort         Duquesne, in the Ohio River valley where the city of         Pittsburgh now stands. This and a second expedition the         next year were both unsuccessful. In 1755 a tragic         episode occurred in Acadia. The Acadian French who         refused to take the oath of allegiance to the English         king were herded aboard transports and shipped to the         English colonies to the south (see Acadia).         American histories refer to the fighting that began in         1754 as the French and Indian War. Canadian and European         histories usually treat the final contest for the         continent as beginning in 1756, with the opening of the         Seven Years' War. (See also French and Indian War;         Seven Years' War.)\nWith the two         motherlands in conflict, the English objective in North         America was to overrun New France and particularly to         seize Quebec, the nerve center of the colony. Under the         skillful generalship of Louis Joseph de Montcalm-Gozon,         marquis de St-Veran, the routes to Quebec down the St.         Lawrence from Lake Ontario and north down the Richelieu         were successfully closed. The first was stopped at         Oswego, and the second at Ticonderoga. The French won         brilliant victories at both these points. The third route         lay up the St. Lawrence, past the French stronghold of         Louisbourg. In 1758 a powerful British force landed on         Cape Breton Island. In the fighting that followed,         Louisbourg fell for the second and last time in its         history. The waterway to Quebec was open at last. In 1759         a fleet of 140 ships, carrying 9,000 troops commanded by         Gen. James Wolfe, sailed up the St. Lawrence and laid         siege to the capital of New France.\nAll summer long         Wolfe tried in vain to find a weakness in the natural         defenses of Quebec, which Montcalm was using so         skillfully. Late in the season, he decided on a secret         but brilliant night landing that led to victory the next         morning in the celebrated battle of the Plains of         Abraham.\nBoth Wolfe and         Montcalm were mortally wounded in the fighting. Montreal,         cut off from all hope of reinforcements and supplies from         France, fell easily before the advancing British forces         the following season. When the Treaty of Paris at last         brought the Seven Years' War to a close in 1763, the         British flag waved over almost the whole of eastern North         America. (See also Montcalm; Wolfe, James.)\nEarly British Rule\nThe British         faced two immediate problems in the vast territory that         had thus been added to their other Atlantic colonies. There were more than 60,000 new French-speaking subjects         in what had formerly been New France. In addition, there         were large tracts of thinly settled wilderness in the         Great Lakes area where their little garrisons were         seriously outnumbered by the Indians.\nLed by a clever         and treacherous Ottawa chieftain named Pontiac, the         Indians suddenly rose against their new English masters         and overthrew these forts one by one, massacring the         soldiers in them without mercy. By the middle of 1763 the         only British soldiers left west of Lake Erie were in Fort         Detroit. It alone among the western forts held out         against Pontiac until fresh troops were rushed in, and         the Indian uprising was subdued at last.\nThe Quebec Act of 1774\nAdministration         of the conquered province by a governor and an appointed         council was established by royal proclamation. In 1774         the English Parliament passed the Quebec Act. This was         the first important milestone in the constitutional         history of British Canada. Under its terms the boundaries         of Quebec were extended as far as the Ohio River valley.         The Roman Catholic church was recognized by the Quebec         Act, and its right to collect tithes was confirmed. Also         of enduring importance was the establishment of the         French civil law to govern the relations of Canadian         subjects in their business and other day-to-day relations         with each other. British criminal law was imposed in all         matters having to do with public law and order and         offenses for which the punishment might be fine,         imprisonment, or in some cases death. These imaginative         gestures on the part of the English government won the         admiration of the religious leaders in Quebec and to a         large extent the goodwill of the people themselves. The         privilege of an elected assembly continued to be         withheld, however.\nThe loyalty of         the new province was soon put to the test. Within a year         of the passing of the Quebec Act, the rebelling 13         Atlantic colonies sent two armies north to capture the \"fourteenth colony.\" Sir Guy Carleton, the         British governor of Canada, narrowly escaped capture when         one of these armies, under Richard Montgomery, took         Montreal. Carleton reached Quebec in time to organize its         small garrison against the forces of Benedict Arnold.         Arnold began a siege of the fortress, in which he was         soon joined by Montgomery. In the midwinter fighting that         followed, Montgomery was killed and Arnold wounded. When         spring came, the attacking forces retreated. During the         rest of the American Revolutionary War, there was no         further fighting on Canadian soil.\nThe United Empire         Loyalists\nWhen peace was         established in 1783, many thousands of Loyalists, who         were referred to as Tories by their fellow countrymen,         left the newly created United States. They started their         lives afresh under the British flag in Nova Scotia and in         the unsettled lands above the St. Lawrence rapids and         north of Lake Ontario.\nThis huge influx         of settlers, who were known in Canada and England as the         United Empire Loyalists, marked the first major wave of         immigration by English-speaking settlers since the days         of New France. Their arrival had two immediate         consequences for the British colonies. Both the Atlantic         province of Nova Scotia and the inland colony of Quebec         had to be reorganized.\nThe previously         unsettled forests to the west of the Bay of Fundy, once         part of French Acadia, had been included in Nova Scotia.         In 1784 this area was established as a separate colony         known as New Brunswick. Cape Breton Island was         simultaneously separated from Nova Scotia (a division         that was ended in 1820). In all, some 35,000 Loyalist         immigrants are believed to have settled in the Maritimes.\nThe settlement         of the more inaccessible lands north and west of Lake         Ontario and along the north shore of the upper St.         Lawrence proceeded somewhat more slowly. About 5,000         Loyalists came to this area.\nUpper and Lower Canada\nIt was clear         that these United Empire Loyalists who had come to the         western wilderness of what was still part of Quebec would         not long be satisfied with the limited rights and French         laws established by the Quebec Act. Accordingly, in 1791         the British Parliament enacted the Constitutional Act,         whereby Quebec was split into the two provinces of Upper         and Lower Canada. Each of these was to be governed by a         legislative council appointed for life and a legislative         assembly elected by the people.\nThe right to be         represented in a lawmaking assembly was something new for         the French-speaking inhabitants of the lower province.         Legislative assemblies had been in existence in Nova         Scotia since 1758, in Prince Edward Island since 1773,         and in New Brunswick since 1786. Representative         government, however, was not responsible government, as         was to be demonstrated before another 50 years had         passed.\nSettlement and         Exploration in the West\nThe Canadian         prairies were not entirely unknown even in the days of New France. As early as the 1730s a family of explorers         headed by Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La         Verendrye, began a series of overland explorations far to         the west of Lake Superior. Their travels carried them         into what is now the western United States, perhaps as         far as the foothills of the Rockies. They visited Lake         Winnipeg, the Red River, the Assiniboine River, and the         Saskatchewan River as far upstream as the fork formed by         the North and the South Saskatchewan.\nThe posts of the         Hudson's Bay Company had given England a preferred         jumping-off point for exploration of the Canadian west.         An expedition under Henry Kelsey explored the territory         between York Factory and northern Saskatchewan in 1690,         long before the journeys of the La Verendryes. In 1754         Anthony Henday traveled from Hudson Bay as far as the         foothills of the Rockies, reaching a point near the site         of present-day Red Deer, Alta. Another Hudson's Bay         Company trader, Samuel Hearne, discovered Great Slave         Lake in 1771, and by descending the Coppermine River to         its mouth, he became the first white man to reach the         Arctic Ocean by land. Although the Rockies still barred         the overland route to the western ocean, the Pacific         coast of Canada was visited by sea in 1778, when Capt.         James Cook explored the northwest coastline from         Vancouver Island to Alaska.\nIn 1783 a group         of Montreal merchants founded the powerful North West         Company. Not only did the new fur-trading company provide         sharp competition, but its trappers explored large parts         of the previously unknown expanses of the Canadian west.         In 1789 Alexander Mackenzie (one of the Nor'westers)         followed the river which now bears his name from its         source to the Arctic Ocean. Disappointed because he had         not discovered a route to the Pacific, he set out on         another expedition in 1792. After a strenuous journey         over the most rugged country on the continent, Mackenzie         and his companions at last crossed the Rocky Mountains to         reach the Fraser River in 1793. From the Fraser they         portaged to the Bella Coola, which they descended until         they sighted the long-sought western sea. Only a few         weeks earlier Capt. George Vancouver had explored the         same part of the Pacific coast by sea.\nMackenzie's         journey was the first made across the continent in either         Canada or the United States. In 1808 the Fraser River was         thoroughly explored by Simon Fraser, after whom it is         named. In 1811 David Thompson completed his exploration         of the Columbia from its source, in southeastern British         Columbia, to its mouth, in present-day Oregon.\nThe Selkirk Settlement\nAlthough fur         trading and settlement did not go well together, Thomas         Douglas, earl of Selkirk, became interested in the         possibilities of settling Scottish farmers who had lost         their farms at home in the fertile valley of the Red         River near present-day Winnipeg. From the Hudson's Bay         Company he purchased a huge tract of 100,000 acres in         this area. In 1812 the first group of Selkirk's settlers         from Scotland and Ireland began to arrive from Hudson         Bay, where they had spent the previous winter.\nThe jealousy of         the Nor'westers, as well as of the half-breeds, known as         metis, was aroused immediately. Fighting broke out         between the new settlers and the established traders. The         colony was permanently established in 1817, when Selkirk         himself arrived with a force of military veterans to put         an end to the troubles and to punish the traders, whom he         held responsible for the bloodshed that had occurred. The         North West Company, a rival fur trading company, brought         a lawsuit against Selkirk for the action he had taken,         and he was forced to pay damages. Although Selkirk         returned to Great Britain in poor health in November 1818         and died a disappointed man a few years later, he had         begun the first permanent settlement on the Canadian         prairies. (See also Fur Trade, History of the;         Manitoba.)\nThe War of 1812\nMeanwhile the         British colonies far to the east found themselves         involved with the United States in a new war that         threatened to end their existence under the English flag.         The declaration of war announced by the United States had         several causes. Chief among these was Britain's         insistence on its right to search American vessels for         deserters from its own navy during the war against         Napoleon. In addition, England had interfered with         American trade with Europe. It was claimed too that the         British in Canada had been inciting the Indians against         the American settlements along the northwestern frontier.\nThe early hopes         of the United States to drive the British entirely from         North America were dashed by a series of defeats at the         hands of British regulars and Canadian militia forces.         Fort Michilimackinac, at the entrance to Lake Michigan,         was captured by the British soon after the outbreak of         fighting and was not recaptured during the remainder of         the war. An American attack across the Detroit border was         not only forced back but, under the brilliant generalship         of Gen. Isaac Brock, ably assisted by the Shawnee         chieftain Tecumseh and his warriors, was turned into a         disastrous defeat. The army defending Detroit was forced         to surrender, and the fort itself fell into British         hands. Later the same year, the United States launched an         attack on the Niagara frontier. Brock was killed early         during the fighting at Queenston Heights, but the         invasion was repulsed.\nAlthough there         were times when the United States occupation of the whole         of Upper Canada seemed almost certain, brilliant         defensive battles turned the tide on every such occasion.         Among the most important engagements were those at         Chateauguay and Crysler's Farm in the autumn of 1813 at a         time when United States forces were threatening to         capture Montreal and cut off the only supply line to         Upper Canada. At Chateauguay Col. Charles de Salaberry         cleverly posted buglers in the woods about the invading         soldiers and convinced the United States troops that they         were surrounded by superior forces. This battle also         provided another opportunity for French Canadians to         fight side by side with their English-speaking         countrymen. The victorious outcome contributed a great         deal to the growing national pride of Canadians in both         Upper and Lower Canada.\nPeace was         finally signed between Great Britain and the United         States on Christmas Eve in 1814. The terms of the treaty         called for the restoration of forts and territories that         had been captured by both countries. The future         sentiments of the British colonies, however, had been         made a little more certain. Strong feelings of national         pride had been aroused among the people. All likelihood         of a union between the United States and Canada had         disappeared. (See also War of 1812.)\nStruggle for         Self-Government\nThe successful         defense of their homeland had not left the Canadians         incapable of seeing faults in their own form of         government. There were those--especially among the         successful businessmen and wealthier landowners--who         believed that the colonists had sufficient powers of         self-government through their elected assemblies. There         were others, however, who saw little advantage in an         assembly whose bills could be defeated by the legislative         council, or could go unsigned by the governor on the         advice of the executive council. The real power did not         lie in the hands of the people through their elected         representatives, but with appointed officials who were         responsible only to the government in Britain. In         practice the power lay in the hands of the governor and         of his executive advisers.\nThe citizens         could use their assembly as little more than a forum in         which to criticize the manner in which the government was         operated. Worse still, local matters that today are dealt         with by elected municipal bodies were all handled by the         central government of each colony.\nMackenzie and Papineau         Rebel\nThe period         following the War of 1812 was one of expansion of         population, business, and settlement. This was especially         true in Upper Canada, where large numbers of newcomers         were attracted by low-cost land grants. The very growth         of the colony offered many opportunities for profit by         those who could control the land grants.\nOne of the         loudest accusers of the government's administration of         the land grants was William Lyon Mackenzie (see Mackenzie, William Lyon). His criticisms centered on a         group that was known as the Family Compact. This was a         loose and somewhat misleading name for the members of the         governing class and their friends, among whom were         actually many leaders of great honesty and competence.         Mackenzie, however, never clearly understood the         principles of responsible government by which the         executive would carry out the wishes of the government         and the government would hold office only so long as it         had the support of the people's elected representatives.         Thus when the government failed to redress the long         series of grievances that he listed, Mackenzie began to         call for the independence of Upper Canada.\nAs affairs in         Upper Canada moved toward a climax, an equally serious         crisis was building in Lower Canada. The grievances were         different, but the causes were similar. Here the real         power was in the hands of a British governor and his         councilors, referred to critically as the Chateau Clique,         who constantly rebuffed the elected representatives of         the French-Canadian majority. The leader of the radical         reforms in Lower Canada was Louis Joseph Papineau (see Papineau). Papineau, like Mackenzie, had been several         times elected to the provincial assembly. Like Mackenzie,         he had finally come to the conclusion that no lasting         reform could be achieved unless the bonds with Britain         were severed.\nRioting occurred         in Montreal in 1837. When the government decided to         arrest Papineau, he immediately fled across the border to         the United States. Largely because the radicals         interpreted this as persecution of their leader, open         rebellion followed in several centers. All revolts were         quickly put down.\nSimilar troubles         broke out in Upper Canada almost immediately. Mackenzie         prematurely called for an advance toward Toronto from his         headquarters just north of the city before his         ill-equipped followers were sufficiently well organized.         The attack was driven back; and the city, rapidly filling         with Loyalist supporters, was fully alerted. A few days         later these forces marched northward against Mackenzie         and, after a short skirmish, dispersed his troops.\nLike Papineau,         Mackenzie fled across the United States border, but he         had not abandoned the struggle. Early in 1838 he took         possession of Navy Island in the Niagara River and, with         a small number of followers, tried to organize his         planned republic under what he spoke of as a \"provisional government of Upper Canada.\" The         army and militia were now in full control of the         situation, and they forced Mackenzie to return to the         United States once again. Other disturbances followed         along the border during 1838. After a few unsuccessful         raids, the United States took steps to prevent its         territory from being used for further attacks against the         Canadas.\nThe struggle for         reform was more peaceful in the Maritimes. Here the         leading reformers included Joseph Howe, in Nova Scotia,         and Lemuel Allan Wilmot, in New Brunswick. Howe had a         much clearer understanding of the principles and         advantages of responsible government than had either         Mackenzie or Papineau. Although he was persecuted for         some of the criticisms he voiced in his newspaper, the Novascotian, he rallied widespread support. When sued for libel, he         won his case.\nThe Durham Report\nThe seriousness         of the troubles in British North America caused deep         concern in Great Britain, where memories of the American         Revolution could be recalled. At the request of Queen         Victoria, who came to the throne in 1837, John George         Lambton, earl of Durham, accepted appointment as governor         in chief of British North America with special powers as         lord high commissioner. He arrived in Quebec in the         spring of 1838; though he ended his stay before the year         was out, his Report on the Affairs of British North         America is one of the most important documents in the         history of the British Empire.\nDurham         recommended that Upper and Lower Canada be united under a         single parliament. He said that if the colonies were         given as much freedom to govern themselves as the people         of Great Britain, they would become more loyal instead of         less so. He even forecast the possibility of a union some         day of all the British colonies in North America. His         only serious error of judgment occurred when he said that         the French-speaking Canadians might be expected to be         absorbed by a growing English-speaking majority. Durham         drove himself and others tirelessly to gather the         information he required for his report during the few         months he was in the country. His political opponents at         home, however, continued to attack him, and, stung by         their criticisms, he returned to England to submit his         findings. He did not live to witness the action that was         taken on his report, for within a year he became ill and         died.\nCanada West and Canada         East\nIn 1840 the Act         of Union was passed. It became effective the next year         and joined Upper and Lower Canada under a central         government. Henceforth the two colonies were to be known         simply as Canada West and Canada East, respectively.         There was to be an appointed upper chamber, or         legislative council, in the new government as well as an         assembly composed of the same number of elected members         from each of the two old colonies. The seat of government         was established at Kingston; but after 1844 it was moved         to Montreal, then back and forth between Toronto and         Quebec, and finally to Ottawa in 1865.\nIn the first         several years of this period, the principle of complete         self-government and the subordination of the governor's         authority to that of Parliament was developed and finally         accepted. It was a critical time in the constitutional         history of Canada, and the ability of the two chief         Canadian nationality groups to get along with each other         was tested for many years.\nEach side         produced great public men. Prominent were Robert Baldwin         from Canada West and Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine from         Canada East (see Baldwin, Robert). Both men had         taken part in the agitation preceding the rebellions of         1837, but they had stood apart from the extreme measures         that led to armed insurrection. Both had grasped the         meaning of responsible government. By joining forces they         formed a strong coalition during the early years of the         new government, and the result was that much legislation         was carried through. Included were laws for establishing         municipal governments, for founding the University of         Toronto as a nonsectarian institution, and for changing         the system of law courts.\nThe real test of         the principle of responsible government took place in         1849. Parliament passed the Rebellion Losses Bill, which         had to go before the governor-general, James Bruce, earl         of Elgin, for his signature to become law. The bill         provided for compensation to those who had suffered         during the rebellion of 1837 in Lower Canada. It was         violently opposed by many of the Tories, who felt that         tax money was being turned over to former rebels.\nThere was some         question as to whether or not Elgin would sign the bill         as his ministers advised him to do. When Elgin decided         that he must sign into law whatever bill was recommended         to him by his Cabinet, he was made the object of a         torrent of abuse from the Tories. Elgin's carriage was         attacked, and his house was stoned. Furthermore, rioting         broke out, and the Parliament Buildings in Montreal were         razed by fire. Out of the ashes of the government         buildings, however, was born true colonial         self-government that embodied the principle of         responsible cabinet rule.\nThe Colonies Grow Up\nIn the meantime         Canada was swelling with settlers, and the foundations of         a British province on the west coast were being laid. A         flood of newcomers began to arrive after the War of 1812,         mostly from the British Isles. About 800,000 immigrants         came to Canada between 1815 and 1850, sometimes spoken of         as the period of the Great Migration. The hardships faced         by the new settlers were many. The trials often began in         the crowded, cholera-ridden, and poorly provisioned         sailing ships that brought the newcomers in vast numbers         across the Atlantic. The building of new settlements went         on in the Maritime Provinces and in the Canadas, and         early in the century Cape Breton Island was settled by         Gaelic-speaking farmers from the Scottish Highlands.\nThe largest         tracts of land available for settlement were in Upper         Canada, where the opening of new subdivisions in the         dense forests was an almost continuous process during         this whole period. One of the largest and most famous of         these was the huge tract of land on the north shore of         Lake Erie acquired by Thomas Talbot in about 1802.         Established in 1803, the Talbot Settlement was governed         by him during the whole period of its development, which         covered almost 50 years. In 1824 a large private         enterprise known as the Canada Company, promoted by John         Galt, was launched with government backing. Settlements         began after the company obtained about 2.5 million acres.         Between 1824 and 1843 the company was responsible for         opening up most of the western part of the province lying         north of the Talbot country.\nUntil the coming         of the railway, the principal method of moving heavy         freight over long distances was by water. Canals in the         colonies were therefore improved, and new ones were dug.         Roads were cut through the bush to connect the far-flung         centers of settlement with lake and river ports. On the         backwoods farms great branding fires burned steadily for         weeks at a time as the pioneers slowly cleared their         lands. As a rule, the stumps were left in the ground to         rot, which required from five to six years for most         woods. Cedar and pine roots might hamper the use of         horse-drawn plows for as long as 15 to 20 years. In most         respects pioneer life was very similar in Canada and the         United States.\nSettlement on the         Pacific Coast\nThe isolation of         the Pacific coast from the rest of Canada was almost         complete during this period. The only practical route         from the Pacific coast to England was by sea around Cape         Horn. When the North West Company was absorbed by the         Hudson's Bay Company in 1821, Dr. John McLoughlin was         sent to superintend the affairs of the latter         organization in the huge area lying between the Rockies         and the Pacific and reaching as far south as California.\nThe boundary         line between United States and British territory on the         west coast was far from clear at this time. The Hudson's         Bay Company possessed a flourishing trading post at Fort         Vancouver on the Columbia River more than 200 miles south         of the present city of Vancouver. For a number of years         this Oregon country (which included the later state of         Washington) was the scene of fur trading and settlement         by the British and Americans alike by common agreement. (See         also Oregon; Washington, State of.)\nIn 1846 the         Oregon Boundary Treaty determined that the international         boundary should follow the 49th parallel, but that         Vancouver Island should remain British. James Douglas,         director of Fort Vancouver, had begun the building of         Fort Victoria, on Vancouver Island, just three years         earlier. Under his supervision it now became the         company's western headquarters.\nThe dominating         importance of the fur trade was challenged in 1858 by the         electrifying news that gold had been discovered on the         Fraser River. Douglas promptly extended his authority to         the mainland, and in this action he was supported by the         British government. There was a great need to bring law         and order to the mining camps arising everywhere in the         new territory. This need was met by Matthew Begbie, a firm and courageous judge whom Douglas called to his         assistance. Many of the miners departed when the gold         rush subsided. The people who stayed formed the nucleus         of the later province of British Columbia.\nOne of the great         engineering accomplishments of Canadian history up to         this time was the building of the Cariboo Road between         1862 and 1865. It ran from the Fraser River port of Yale         to the heart of the Cariboo gold-mining country, about         400 miles upstream. The territory it ran through was         almost impassable.\nThe Confederation Idea\nSentiment bound         the Canadas, the Maritimes, and British Columbia more         closely to England than to each other. There were         different standards of currency in use in the several         colonies, and trade between them was complicated by         customs barriers. Their everyday business brought them         into close touch with the United States. When the St.         Lawrence ports of Quebec and Montreal were frozen in,         news and even passengers traveled on the new United         States railways across the eastern states from New York         to the Canadian border. The newly invented magnetic         telegraph, which was installed in Toronto in 1846, soon         connected that city not only with Quebec but also with         New York City and New Orleans in the United States.\nFrom 1861 to         1865 people in the British colonies watched with interest         and uneasiness the course of the American Civil War (see Civil War, American). From this great conflict they saw         arise a freshly united nation, powerfully equipped with         what were now surplus tools of war and, in the opinion of         many, only too willing to use them against the         neighboring colonies of Great Britain. Britain had almost         gone to war against the North because the North's         blockade of Southern shipping interfered with Britain's         cotton trade. The absorption of the British colonies into         the United States was again being called for by United         States extremists who revived the old cry of \"manifest destiny\" of their republic.\nLord Elgin had         negotiated a ten-year trade treaty with the United States         whereby tariffs were reduced on a reciprocal basis on         many items. The resulting stimulation of trade was         scheduled to cease in 1864, when United States renewal of         the treaty was withheld. The desirability of substituting         increased intercolonial trade was recognized by everyone         in Canada and the Maritimes.\nThe government         of the Canadas under the Act of Union was running into         difficulties because Canada West by this time had         increased in population faster than Canada East. The act         had provided for equal representation of both parts of         the colony at a time when French-speaking Canada East was         numerically much larger than Canada West. A state of         almost continuous deadlock ensued in Parliament, with no         government able to secure a clear majority.\nBetween 1861 and         1864 four separate ministries and two general elections         failed to end the impasse. In 1864 a coalition headed by         the leader of the Conservatives, John A. Macdonald, and         Liberal leader George Brown, who was founder of the Toronto         Globe, gave promise of a more stable government (see Macdonald). Macdonald, with his trusted ally         Georges-Etienne Cartier from Canada East, then obtained         Brown's assurance of cooperation in the best interests of         the country, even though Brown had long considered         Macdonald and Cartier his deadly political enemies.\nThe coalition         government wanted to work out some form of federal union         to include the Maritime Provinces if they were willing.         Provincial matters would be left to the individual         provinces. Only subjects of concern to all the provinces         would be dealt with by the federal government.\nDominion from Sea to         Sea\nBy fortunate         coincidence, the possibility of a local union of colonies         was under discussion at this very time in the Maritimes.         A conference was convened in Charlottetown, P.E.I., in         1864 to discuss the question. Macdonald, accompanied by         Brown and Cartier, headed a delegation from Canada to         this meeting of their Maritime cousins. They set forth         the possible advantages of a union wide enough to include         the Canadas as well. It was quickly agreed that another         meeting should be held to consider the plan further. The         result was the Quebec Conference, which was held later         the same year. Agreements in principle on the conditions         that might permit so ambitious a union were finally         reached. These agreements were summed up in the         Seventy-two Resolutions.\nAs if to lend         emphasis to the importance of such a union, the         anti-British Fenians in the United States were voicing         plans to strike a blow for Irish independence at home by         invading the British colonies in North America. In 1866         this threat culminated in a series of raids across the         border into Canada, which were successfully repulsed. The         United States took steps to preserve its neutrality by         suppressing further Fenian attacks from its side of the         border. Some of the national spirit of 1812 to 1814 was rekindled in the British colonies and served to         strengthen the movement toward confederation.\nIn 1866         representatives of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the         Canadas came together in London for final discussions         with the Colonial Office. Newfoundland and Prince Edward         Island for the moment had withdrawn from the         confederation talks. The London Conference led directly         to the most important statute in Canadian constitutional         history, the British North America Act of 1867. This act,         with its subsequent amendments, embodied the written         constitution of Canada for more than a century. It was         proclaimed on July 1, now celebrated as Canada Day.\nThe British         North America Act provided that there should be four         provinces in the new Dominion at the outset--Ontario,         Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia--and that others         could join later. Each province was to have its own seat         of government, its own lawmaking body, and its own         lieutenant governor to represent the Crown. In addition,         the act established a federal government at Ottawa,         composed of a House of Commons (elected), a Senate         (appointed for life), and a governor-general as the         Crown's representative. It set forth the matters on which         the provinces could make laws and listed those that were         the special concern of the government at Ottawa. Any         powers not listed were to belong to the federal         government. (The act remained in force until the         Constitution Act of 1982.)\nNew Dominion Is         Launched\nThe first         Parliament of the new Dominion met on Nov. 6, 1867, with         Macdonald as prime minister. By the Deed of Surrender of         1869, Canada purchased the vast Northwest Territories         from the Hudson's Bay Company. The company was permitted         to retain trading rights in the area and a small         percentage of the prairie lands. (See also Hudson's Bay Company.)\nThe only western         settlement of importance east of the Rockies was the Red         River colony in Manitoba, which had attained a population         of some 12,000 since Selkirk's time. The metis were the         most numerous of these settlers. Their leader, Louis         Riel, defied the new governor sent out to take over         possession of the territory from the Hudson's Bay         Company. Riel seized Fort Garry, set up his own         provisional government, and forwarded demands to Ottawa         that the civil rights and the land rights of the people         be protected. At this point Riel might easily have won a         place in Canadian history as the father of Manitoba, but         he committed the grave error of imprisoning some of the         Ontario settlers who opposed him and of having one of         them, Thomas Scott, executed.\nCalmer judgments         prevailed when Donald Smith (later Lord Strathcona) and         Bishop Alexandre Tache, the religious leader of the Red         River Settlement, went to Ottawa and obtained passage of         the Manitoba Act of 1870. By this act Manitoba was         constituted a province, with its seat of government at         Fort Garry (later Winnipeg). But it was a much smaller         province, amounting to little more than the Red River         Settlement. The right of the French-speaking inhabitants         to their own religion and schools was recognized.         Soldiers under Col. (later Sir) Garnet Wolseley were sent         to Fort Garry to bring law and order on authority from         Ottawa. Riel allowed his provisional government to         collapse and fled from the new province. The Red River         Rebellion was ended but not the career of Riel.\nThe first         Dominion census, which was taken in 1871 in accordance         with the British North America Act, showed a population         of 3,689,257. In the same year the Treaty of Washington         was signed between Great Britain and the United States,         which settled United States and Canadian use of the Great         Lakes-St. Lawrence system and the Yukon River in Alaska.         The United States was accorded fishing rights in Canadian         Atlantic waters for a limited period in return for 5 1/2         million dollars in compensation. Among the five         commissioners who represented Great Britain in these         negotiations was Macdonald. His presence was a         recognition of Canada's new status in the British Empire.\nDuring the same         summer of 1871, British Columbia joined the new Canada         Confederation. Improvement in overland communications was         a primary condition imposed by the new province.         Macdonald pledged that the Dominion government would         begin construction of a transcontinental railway within         two years and complete it within ten years.\nProgress on the         Intercolonial Railway, which was to link the Maritimes         with Quebec, encouraged Prince Edward Island in 1873 to         become the seventh province in the Dominion. The         transcontinental railway project already was requiring         heavy financial commitments by the government, and         Macdonald was under considerable pressure in the House of         Commons as well as in the press. He won the election of         1872, only to face charges by his political enemies that         railway contractors had contributed heavily to his         party's election funds. The Pacific Scandal, as this         incident was named, defeated the Conservatives in 1873.         Alexander Mackenzie headed the Liberal government that         then took office.\nMackenzie's         contribution to the infant Dominion was real though         unspectacular. During his term in office from 1873 to         1878, voting by ballot was introduced in 1874; the         Supreme Court of Canada held its first sitting in 1876;         and the Intercolonial Railway ran its first train from         Halifax to Quebec, also in 1876. A tireless worker and a         man of high personal integrity, Mackenzie nevertheless         did not have great popular appeal. When Macdonald fought         the 1878 election on a platform of protectionist tariffs,         which he called his National Policy, the voters favored         their \"old chieftain.\" The Conservatives thus         were returned to office.\nMacdonald's National         Policy\nMacdonald sought         to strengthen the new Dominion both at home and abroad.         He could foresee the ultimate evolution of something akin         to the modern British Commonwealth, in which Canada would         be an equal partner with the mother country. During the         seven years following his return to office, his         government adopted its previously announced protective         tariff (1879), appointed Canada's first high commissioner         to London (1880), annexed the Arctic Archipelago (1880),         and completed the overdue transcontinental railway         (1885).\nIn 1885 word of         a new crisis was flashed from the Northwest Territories.         Louis Riel was leading the metis of the valley of the         South Saskatchewan in a new uprising against the federal         government, and this time he had aroused numbers of the         Indians to fight beside him. A militia force was hastily         dispatched under Gen. Frederick Middleton over the         completed portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Within         a few weeks the Northwest Rebellion was put down and Riel         was arrested. His trial for treason and his execution         aroused wide controversy across Canada and to a         considerable extent cost the Conservative party the         support of French-speaking Canadians for many decades.\nMacdonald's         National Policy was by now the chief target of the         Liberals, who were calling for \"unrestricted         reciprocity\" in trade with the United States.         Macdonald won the 1891 election. His health was failing,         however, and later that year he died.\nBecause of their         government majority, the Conservatives were not required         to call a new election for five years. During this time,         however, they had to select four prime ministers in         succession--Sir John J.C. Abbott (1891-92), Sir John S.D.         Thompson (1892-94), Sir Mackenzie Bowell (1894-96), and         Sir Charles Tupper (1896). Finally the Conservative party         foundered, under Tupper's leadership, on the thorny         Manitoba School Question. Manitoba had abolished its         separate Roman Catholic schools a few years earlier. This         was allegedly in violation of provisions in the Manitoba         Act and the British North America Act. The provincial         government's action was upheld, however, by the Judicial         Committee of the Privy Council. (See also Abbott;         Thompson, John Sparrow David; Tupper.)\nThe new Liberal         leader, Wilfrid Laurier, a French-speaking Canadian,         favored conciliation rather than coercion. The         Conservatives were defeated on the issue in the election;         and the responsibility of government passed to the         Liberals, under Laurier.\nThe Age of Laurier\nWilfrid         Laurier's regime lasted 15 years. It was one of renewed         growth and prosperity. The Manitoba School Question was         promptly hushed up by new legislation enacted by the         province in accordance with a compromise worked out with         Ottawa. To his Cabinet Laurier drew some of the most         capable leaders from every part of Canada.\nBusiness         throughout the world was on an upswing, and the Laurier         government rode the crest. The demand for Canadian wheat         abroad encouraged immigration, and immigration in turn         increased farm production and the value of national         exports. \"The 20th century belongs to Canada,\" cried Laurier; and the whole nation took confidence from         his assurance. Two new transcontinental railways were         begun. By 1905 the west had expanded in both population         and economic strength to such an extent that two new         provinces, Alberta and Saskatchewan, were carved out of         the Northwest Territories.\nThese         encouraging developments were inadvertently assisted by         an occurrence in the far northwest. Since the Fraser         River gold strike of 1858, prospectors had been         consistently combing the mountainous areas of British         Columbia and to the north. In 1896 their persistence paid         off with the discovery of gold nuggets on the Klondike         River in the far western Yukon Territory. When the news         spread, the gold rush of 1897 began; it was to become the         most publicized gold rush in history, eventually to be         celebrated in the works of such writers as Jack London         and Robert Service.\nThe gold strike         had some beneficial side effects. As miners poured into         western Canada from the United States and other parts of         the world, the extent of the unpopulated prairie lands         became known. By this time, of course, the supply of free         land in the United States had become exhausted, and the         frontier was closed. Very soon after the gold rush,         settlers began pouring into the western prairies of         Canada by the thousands, from Europe as well as the         United States. They came from as far away as Russia to         establish farms on the open wheatlands. It was not long         before demands arose for the creation of at least one         province between Manitoba and British Columbia. Thus, in         1905, the government in Ottawa formed two new provinces,         Alberta and Saskatchewan.\nAnother benefit         resulting, at least in part, from the gold rush was the         discovery of other minerals in the Canadian wilds. As         early as 1883, nickel had been found at Sudbury, Ont. In         the early 1890s large deposits of base-metal ores were         found in southern British Columbia. After 1900 a rich         deposit of silver was discovered north of Lake Nipissing         in Ontario. Canada soon became perceived around the world         as a mineral-rich nation with great untapped potential.\nThe new prime         minister thus basked in an environment of progress and         prosperity after a depression that had lasted more than         20 years. Laurier's only serious political difficulties         stemmed from his inability to satisfy fully the         imperialists among his followers. Great Britain received         support in the Boer War of 1899-1902 from the other         self-governing colonies, and Laurier reluctantly         committed Canada as well (see Boer War). His         decision, however, sharpened the controversy between the         two nationality groups regarding Canada's proper         responsibilities to Britain in the future. On the other         hand, he continued to resist pressures to tie the bonds         of empire still more tightly during the years after the         victory in South Africa. Seeds of distrust concerning his         policies were thus sown on both sides of the wall that         was rising between Canadians of French and of English         descent.\nAnother foreign         policy issue arose as naval competition increased between         Germany and Britain in the years before World War I.         Great Britain naturally desired to receive military help         from the colonies, and again Laurier found a compromise         that satisfied neither the pro-British faction nor the         French partisans. He founded the Canadian Navy in 1910         with the provision that in time of war it be placed under         British command. This quickly led to accusations that         Canadian soldiers would be drafted into the British Army         if war came.\nIn 1911, when         his opponents denounced his government's decision to         implement a limited reciprocity pact with the United         States, Laurier felt he was on firmer ground and called a         general election. His defeat, which occurred largely on         this issue, showed that the prospering nation's         reservations regarding his policies were exceeded only by         its lingering distrust of the United States. (See also Laurier.)\nCanada and World War I\nThe new         Conservative government, headed by Robert Laird Borden,         had the responsibility of rallying the nation to         Britain's side in World War I (see Borden). Had         Canadians remained as divided as they were at the end of         Laurier's term, this might have been a difficult thing to         do. But Germany's invasion of neutral Belgium in 1914         forged a unity of Canadian sentiment and a demand for         participation in the conflict.\nThe first         Canadian contingent, numbering 33,000, reached England         soon after the outbreak of war in 1914, and it was in the         thick of the fighting on the continent a few months later         in the second battle of Ypres. By 1916 the Canadians had         formed four divisions, with a fifth to provide         reinforcements. The four divisions of the Canada Corps         earned an outstanding reputation as a fighting force.         More significant, however, was the fact that Canada was         playing a respectable role on the world stage, a role         that would soon help undo its colonial status.\nBefore the war         ended in 1918, more than 619,000 officers and men had         enlisted, including some 22,000 who had served in the         British Royal Air Force. More than 60,000 Canadians were         killed in action or died of wounds, a terribly heavy toll         in relation to the country's population. Over 66 million         shells were produced in Canadian factories. The gross         national debt soared from 544 million dollars in 1914 to         almost 2 1/2 billion dollars in 1919, most of the money         being raised in Canada itself through public war loans.\nThe Canadian         forces at the outset were made up wholly of volunteers.         Casualties and the rapidly accelerating pace of the war         made the bitter question of conscription a major issue by         1917. Borden met it by forming a coalition government of         Conservatives and Liberals, though Laurier refused to         join the coalition. In the election of that year, Quebec         was almost unanimous in its opposition to the         conscription policy that was supported elsewhere across         the country. The political solidarity of the province         during the next 25 years was largely derived from its         memory of that episode.\nOn the battlefronts in France and Belgium, Canadians of both         nationality backgrounds made magnificent contributions to         the final victory. They faced with heroism the first         poison-gas attack in the history of warfare during the         second battle of Ypres in 1915. Other engagements in         which Canadian forces earned the admiration of all the         Allies included the battles of Mount Sorrel (1916), the         Somme (1916), and Vimy Ridge (1917). The victory of         Passchendaele Ridge in the autumn of 1917 alone cost         16,000 Canadian casualties. In 1918 during the closing         months of the war, Canadians again saw heavy action at         Amiens, Cambrai, and Mons.\nCanada Between the         Wars\nAt the end of         1919 the Canadian government acquired the Grand Trunk         Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Grand Trunk and         merged them to create the publicly owned Canadian         National Railways. Upon Borden's retirement in 1920,         Arthur Meighen succeeded as prime minister. The election         of 1921 brought the Liberals back into office under a new         leader, William Lyon Mackenzie King (see King,         Mackenzie). Because the government had a bare majority,         it depended upon the support of the Progressive (Farmer)         party members.\nAfter four years         of timid Liberal leadership, a new election strengthened         the Conservative representation but not quite to the         point of giving the party control of Parliament. This was         accomplished in 1926, when a scandal in the Department of         Customs and Excise cost the Liberals their majority in         the House. By political shrewdness, however, King forced         Meighen's second government to go to the people for an         election within a matter of days; and the Liberals were once more returned to power.\nThe 1920s were         marked everywhere by a spiraling expansion of business.         Technical and industrial advances paced the rising         standard of living. In the summer of 1929 industrial         production began to slow significantly. In October of         that year the stock market crash heralded unemployment         and financial ruin across Canada, as it did elsewhere in         the world. Defeated in the 1930 elections, King made way         for the Conservatives under Richard Bedford Bennett         (later Viscount Bennett). Bennett thus had the unenviable         responsibility of dealing with the Great Depression. His         inability to deal with the crisis, coupled with the         severe drought in the prairies, led Canadians to desert         the Conservatives. The election of 1935 brought the         Liberals back into office, a position they were to         continue to hold without interruption for 22 years.\nThe British         Commonwealth of Nations\nThe period         between the wars brought the culmination of Canada's         growth to independent nationhood within the British         Commonwealth. Prime Minister Borden had been included in         the Imperial War Cabinet in London. He piloted through         the Imperial Conference of 1917 a resolution that the         dominions \"should be recognized as autonomous         nations of an imperial commonwealth.\" To both the         1919 Peace Conference and the League of Nations Canada         sent its own delegates. The Imperial Conference of 1926         confirmed in its Declaration of Equality that the United         Kingdom as well as the dominions had become \"autonomous Communities within the British Empire,         equal in status, in no way subordinate one to         another.\" They were, however, \"united by a         common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as         members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.\" These resolutions were confirmed by the British         Parliament in 1931 in the Statute of Westminster.\nThe statute         provided that no law passed in the future by the United         Kingdom should extend to any dominion \"except at the         request and with the consent of that Dominion.\" Canadian sovereignty thus had been achieved by a long         process of peaceful constitutional evolution. This was         vividly demonstrated by the independent decision of its         Parliament that Canada enter World War II at the side of         Britain, which it did within a week of the outbreak of         hostilities in September 1939.\nCanada and World War         II\nWithin three         months an entire division of the new Canadian Active         Service Force had been transported to the United Kingdom,         and an agreement had been announced for a British         Commonwealth Air Training Plan to be centered in Canada.         This project alone trained more than 131,000 aircrew         personnel for the Commonwealth. Canada contributed 72,800         pilots, navigators, aerial gunners and bombardiers, and         flight engineers. These Canadians saw service in almost         every theater of war. The Royal Canadian Navy was         increased from fewer than a dozen vessels to more than         400. It served primarily as an antisubmarine and convoy         force in the North Atlantic. Some of its units were         deployed from time to time as far away as the         Mediterranean and the Pacific.\nThe forces under         the command of Gen. A.G.L. McNaughton were required to         spend a long and frustrating period on vital guard duty         in Britain throughout the period of greatest threat of         German invasion. Elsewhere abroad, two Canadian         battalions sent to Hong Kong in 1941 were overrun when         the colony was captured by the Japanese at the end of         that year. The first engagement of the enemy by Canadian         forces based in England occurred in 1942 in a courageous,         but terribly costly, commando-type raid against Dieppe.         In the summer of 1943 Canadian troops were sent into         action with the British in the successful assault against         Sicily, whence they carried the campaign to the Italian         mainland.\nEarly in 1945         the Canadians were withdrawn from Italy to permit         reunification of the Canadian Army in northwestern         Europe. The climax of the war had already come, however,         with the Normandy landings in June 1944, in which the         Canadian Army played an important part. Instrumental in         the capture of Caen, which followed, the Canadians won         another major victory in the closing of the Falaise gap         later the same summer. In the costly and difficult battle         of the Scheldt estuary that autumn, the Canadians cleared         the sea passage to Antwerp, already in Allied hands. In         the bitter battle along the Hochwald Ridge in February         1945, Canadian losses were extremely heavy. This battle         opened the final attack across the Rhine, which was a         prelude to the unconditional surrender by Germany on May         7, 1945.\nAll persons over         16 years of age were required to take part in a national         registration for war service, and compulsory military         service for home defense only was introduced. Prime         Minister King had assured the nation that there would be         no conscription for overseas duty. As the war wore on,         however, it became increasingly clear that the government         needed to be released from the commitment. King accomplished this by a national plebiscite. All the         provinces except Quebec voted in favor of conscription         for overseas service if necessary. In 1944, after the         Normandy invasion, the drain on manpower became so severe         that draftees were sent overseas for the first time as         reinforcements for the troops in Europe.\nThe losses in         the war overseas were complemented by economic gains on         the homefront. War productivity effectively ended the         Great Depression and greatly increased the labor force.         Canadian workers produced raw materials, farm products,         and manufactured goods needed to fight the war; and this         was all done in a volume unprecedented in Canadian         history. Industrialization was thus rapidly advanced,         through both investment of capital and striking advances         in technology. (See also World War II.)\nPostwar Developments\nCanada played an         active role in the United Nations from the time of the         organization's inception after the war (see United         Nations). King retired in favor of Louis St. Laurent in         1948, after having held office for a longer period than         any other prime minister in Canada's history (see Saint Laurent). In 1949 Newfoundland joined the         Confederation as the tenth province. In the same year         Canada became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty         Organization. When the United Nations took action to         defend South Korea from invasion by North Korea, Canada         contributed units from all three branches of its armed         forces. During the hostilities (1950-53) approximately         27,000 Canadians saw service in the Far East.\nThe appointment         of the first native-born Canadian as governor-general         occurred when the Rt. Hon. Vincent Massey was sworn into         office in 1952. Massey had been chairman of the Royal         Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters         and Sciences.\nThe St. Lawrence         Seaway was opened in 1959. It was formally dedicated by         Queen Elizabeth II and President Dwight D. Eisenhower of         the United States. (See also Saint Lawrence         River.)\nOn Feb. 15,         1965, Canada raised a red and white maple-leaf flag. It         was adopted by Parliament in December 1964 and was         Canada's first official national flag.\nCentennial of Canadian         Confederation\nThe year 1967         marked the 100th anniversary of the British North America         Act, which had been proclaimed on July 1, 1867, and         established the basis for the modern state of Canada. A         giant birthday party on Parliament Hill in Ottawa was         attended by Queen Elizabeth II. A highlight of the year         was the Universal and International Exhibition, known as         Expo '67, held in Montreal. Also to mark the centennial,         Winnipeg, Man., was host to the fifth Pan-American Games,         and the Order of Canada was instituted to reward         Canadians for outstanding merit and service.\nIn 1982 the         British North America Act was replaced by a new         constitution for the government of Canada. Queen         Elizabeth visited Parliament Hill to proclaim the         document. This completed the transfer of constitutional         powers from Great Britain to Canada. (See also Canada Confederation, Fathers of.)\nQuebec Separatism\nBeginning in the         1960s Quebec was the center of militant agitation to         separate it from Canada and establish a French-speaking         nation. In 1969 French and English were both declared the         official languages of Canada. In 1970 terrorist acts by         alleged separatists were climaxed by the kidnapping and         murder of Quebec's minister of labor and immigration,         Pierre Laporte. The federal government sent in troops and         temporarily suspended civil liberties. In 1974 French         became the official language of the province.\nA party pledged         to Quebec separatism won the 1976 provincial election and         passed several measures to strengthen the movement. Under         a controversial law adopted in 1977, education in         English-language schools was greatly restricted. The         charter also changed English place-names and imposed         French as the language of business, court judgments,         laws, government regulations, and public institutions.\nAlthough the         separatist party retained power, a referendum to make the         province an independent country was rejected by the         Quebec voters in 1980. The Quebec government opposed the         1982 constitution, which included a provision for freedom         of language in education, and unsuccessfully sought a         veto over constitutional change. In 1984 the Supreme         Court ruled against Quebec's schooling restrictions.\nIn 1987 the         Meech Lake constitutional accord recognized Quebec as a \"distinct society\" and transferred extensive         new powers to all the provinces. Quebec promised that it         would accept the 1982 constitution if the accord was         approved by all the rest of the provinces. The House of         Commons ratified the Meech Lake accord on June 22, 1988,         but the accord died on June 23, 1990, after Newfoundland         and Manitoba withheld their support. A new set of         constitutional proposals hammered out by a parliamentary         committee was agreed upon in 1992. They called for         decentralization of federal powers, an elected Senate,         and special recognition of Quebec as a distinct society.         In a referendum held in October 1992, Canadians         decisively turned down the constitutional changes. Quebec         voters narrowly rejected secession from Canada in a 1995         referendum. (See also Quebec.)\nModern Canadian         Leadership\nThe long period         of Liberal domination in Parliament ended in 1957. The         St. Laurent government was replaced when the Progressive         Conservatives (called Conservatives before 1942) took         office under the prime ministership of John G.         Diefenbaker (see Diefenbaker, John).\nIn the 1962         elections the Progressive Conservatives lost their         control of Parliament, but no other party was able to win         a majority. Diefenbaker, as leader of the largest         minority party, formed a weak coalition government. In         February 1963 his government fell on the issue of         Canada's failure to execute its 1958 commitments to         accept nuclear weapons from the United States for the         joint defense of North America.\nIn general         elections on April 8 the Liberals won more seats than any         other party, and Liberal leader Lester B. Pearson was         named prime minister of Canada in 1963 at the head of         another minority government (see Pearson, Lester         B.). In 1968 the Liberals chose Pierre Elliott Trudeau to         succeed him (see Trudeau, Pierre Elliott). In the         general elections in June, Trudeau won, with the Liberals         taking a majority. This was the first election to use the         electoral constituency boundaries of 1965.\nIn the October         1972 elections Trudeau's Liberals won but failed to gain         a majority. They were able to stay in power with New         Democratic support, but in May 1974 Trudeau's government         fell. The Liberals won a new majority in the July         parliamentary elections.\nEconomic issues         brought about the Liberals' defeat five years later. The         Progressive Conservatives, led by Joe Clark, formed a         minority government that fell after only six months (see Clark, Joe). Although Trudeau resigned his party         leadership in November 1979, he was again named prime         minister in 1980.\nTrudeau resigned         once again in 1984 and was succeeded by John Turner on         June 30. On July 9, Turner called for dissolving         Parliament and holding a new election. He retained         ministers from the Trudeau Cabinet and appointed Trudeau         supporters to the Senate, courts, and diplomatic posts.\nDissatisfaction         with this continuation of Trudeau's influence led to         victory in the September election for the Progressive         Conservatives, under the leadership of Brian Mulroney (see Mulroney, Brian). Mulroney sought to improve relations         with the United States.\nIn October 1987         Canada and the United States reached agreement on a trade         pact to eliminate all bilateral tariffs over a ten-year         period beginning Jan. 1, 1989. The two countries signed a         Great Lakes water-quality agreement in November. Both         countries agreed to track and clean up sources of         pollution.\nIn January 1988         abortion was legalized in Canada. Victories by Mulroney         and his Conservative party in the November 1988 elections         guaranteed passage of the free-trade agreement.\nThe socialist         New Democratic party chose Audrey McLaughlin, the member         of Parliament from the Yukon, as its leader in 1989--the         first woman to head a major Canadian political party.         While the international political climate became more         conservative, the party began to dominate Canadian         leadership in the early 1990s. New Democrats were elected         premiers of the provinces of Ontario, Saskatchewan, and         British Columbia.\nWith his         popularity slumping, Mulroney resigned in February 1993.         He was succeeded by Kim Campbell, who became the first         female prime minister in Canadian history. Campbell and         the Conservatives were annihilated in the October 1993         elections, retaining only two seats in the House of         Commons. The Liberal party won 177 seats to take control         of the government, and Jean Chretien became prime         minister.\nNative Peoples Issues\nA series of         protests by native peoples swept across Canada in 1990.         On March 11 a Mohawk group set up a blockade to stop the         town of Oka, Que., from expanding a golf course on 55         acres (22 hectares) they claimed as ancestral territory.         On July 11 a force of 100 Quebec police officers attacked         the blockade, setting off a gun battle in which one         police officer was killed. The Mohawks held the blockade         for 11 weeks, finally surrendering to the Army in         September. Another group of Indians blockaded the Mercier         Bridge, one of the four main bridges into Montreal.\nIn other         disputes over land claims, different Indian groups set up         several blockades of the rail lines in Ontario and in         British Columbia, disrupting freight and passenger         service. In southwestern Ontario five hydro transmission         towers were toppled in September. A Canadian National         Railway bridge was destroyed by fire. Other native         peoples blocked roads and highways to draw attention to         their concerns. A group of Peigan Indians defended a         diversion of the Oldman River which they had built to         protest the construction of a dam that they said would         destroy their lands.\nOn May 4, 1992,         voters in the Northwest Territories authorized the         partition of their huge area into two separate         territories, one to become a self-governing homeland for         Inuit, or Eskimos. The eastern portion, covering 772,260         square miles (2,000,144 square kilometers), was inhabited         by about 17,500 Inuit. The new territory was to be called         Nunavut, meaning Our Land. Although the plebiscite was         not binding on the Canadian government, the agreement was         expected to be ratified and to go into effect by 1999.         Later in the year the government agreed that Indians and         Inuit have the right of self-government."

Berry et Kitrina Bevan for the Bank of Canada in 2008.\nBy Paul S. Berry et Kitrina Bevan, Banque du Canada | Sunday, June 1, 2008\nNorth West Company: Brass Token, 1820\nThe North West Company was one of the most important companies engaged in the fur trade during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The company began about 1775 as a loose partnership of men from Scottish, French-Canadian and U.S. backgrounds. By 1804 it was a well-organized business offering strong competition to the Hudson's Bay Company.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nIn 1670 Charles II of Britain granted a charter to the \"Governor and Company of Adventurers of England Tradeing [sic] into Hudson's Bay\" giving the company absolute control over the territory drained by the rivers flowing into Hudson Bay.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nHudson's Bay Company: One-Dollar Counterstamped Trade Token\nWhen the Hudson's Bay Company began trade with the First Nations, goods were bartered directly. Gradually, however, counters such as ivory discs, small wooden sticks and other objects were introduced to facilitate the transactions. About the middle of the 19th century, tokens with a stamped value replaced these counters.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nHudson's Bay Company: One Dollar Trade Token\nThe Governor and Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudson's Bay, better known as the Hudson's Bay Company, was founded in 1670. A little over one hundred and fifty years later, trading posts had been established from Hudson's Bay to the Pacific Ocean, forming the world's first chain of department stores.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nBeaver Preserve Token\nThe beaver, or more specifically, the trade in its valuable pelt, played a central role in the early exploration and settlement of Canada. However, the increasing demand for pelts eventually took its toll on beaver populations. The lands around Hudson and James Bays once teemed with beaver, but by 1930 overhunting and disease had reduced the population to near extinction.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nNew France, Franco-American Jeton, 1740\nIn the days before adding machines and other automatic calculators, Europeans used jetons or counters for carrying out simple arithmetical calculations. For example, if livres, sols and deniers were being added in France or pounds, shillings and pence in England, a box with three compartments would be used, one for each denomination.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nNew France, Louis XIV, 15 Sols, 1670\nThe first coins issued for use in what was later to become Canada were minted over 300 years ago, or nearly 200 years before Confederation. In the early days of New France, the need for a local currency was partially met by the use of ordinary French coins.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nTokens and Army Bills\nIt took some time before the public regained its confidence in paper money, as the bad taste left by the notes of the French colonial period lingered. During the War of 1812 between the United States and the colonies of British North America, the Canadian colonial authorities began to issue \"army\" bills.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nLower Canada, bridge token, c.1808\nIn 1808 three bridges were built linking \"Bout de l'Ile\" or the east end of Montreal Island, with the mainland via Bourdon Island. The Bout de l'lle bridge connected Montreal Island with the smaller Bourdon Island and from there two bridges, the Lachenaie bridge and the Repentigny bridge, were built linking Bourdon Island with the mainland at the confluence of the Assumption and St. Lawrence Rivers.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nLower Canada, Vexator Canadiensis, one halfpenny token, 1811\nIllustrated is the obverse of one of the most interesting and, at the same time, most puzzling of the various coppers issued privately in Canada in the last century. Called the VEXATOR CANADIENSIS tokens, this group of crudely executed pieces was struck after 1830 bearing the false date 1811. It is now believed that these tokens were intended not only to serve as change but that they also had a satirical purpose.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nLower Canada, Lauzon ferry token, 1821\nThis is one of the earliest Canadian examples of a transportation token. The vessel on the token is the Lauzon, a 310-ton steam-powered side-wheeler. It was built and owned by John Goudie. The first steam-propelled vessel to make regular crossings of the St. Lawrence River between Quebec City and Levis, the Lauzon operated daily from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. between 1817 and 1828, making as well an occasional trip to Montreal.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nLower Canada, Montreal British Militia button, one halfpenny token, c. 1830\nWhen faced with shortages of official coinage, Canada's early citizens resorted to a variety of novel substitutes such as playing cards, paper I.O.U.s, and even brass buttons. The illustration features one such button used during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. At that time Canada produced no coinage of its own, so people accepted whatever tokens and foreign coins were available.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nLower Canada, Tiffen token, one halfpenny, 1812\nNowhere in British North America did the private copper tokens issued by merchants and others have a more fascinating evolutionary history than in Lower Canada - now Quebec. In the 1820s and 1830s, trade in Montreal, the colony's commercial centre, created a strong demand for coinage. As coins were often in short supply, privately produced tokens filled the void.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nThe Magdalen Islands, a group of 16 islands situated in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, were discovered by Jacques Cartier during his voyage to the Gaspe in 1534.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nLower Canada, Blacksmith token, one halfpenny, c. 1830\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the great variety of coins in common usage in British North America contributed to a very chaotic currency situation that left the system open to many abuses. Nowhere was this more evident than in Lower Canada. To compensate for the shortage of circulating coins, it was the practice for merchants to issue their own copper tokens.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nLower Canada, Molson, one halfpenny token, 1837\nIn 1763 France and England signed the Treaty of Paris and Canada became a British possession. Sixty years later the mother country had made no effort to provide an official currency for the young colony. By this time several private banks were in operation and they issued paper money which served to facilitate large business transactions.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nUpper Canada, Sir Isaac Brock, one halfpenny token, 1816\nIn the opening phases of the War of 1812, Major General Sir Isaac Brock, commander of the British forces in Upper Canada, distinguished himself in his untiring efforts in the province's defence, culminating with a decisive victory over the U.S. forces at Detroit. Brock was killed on 13 October 1812 during an attack by invading U.S. forces at Queenston Heights on the Niagara frontier.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nUpper Canada, Lesslie & Sons, two- penny token, 1822\nDuring much of the century preceding Confederation there was a chronic shortage of small change in all the British provinces. No official coins were provided for either Upper or Lower Canada and the foreign coins brought into the country tended to flow out again. The gap was partially filled by enterprising merchants who issued their own tokens as a local coinage.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nPrince Edward Island, Ships, Colonies & Commerce one halfpenny token, 1830 - 1860\nOne of the commonest kinds of metallic tokens issued in Canada by merchants and others to alleviate the shortage of coins were the ones bearing a ship on the obverse side and the inscription SHIPS, COLONIES & COMMERCE on the reverse. The inscription refers to the famous statement made by Napoleon in 1811 that ships, colonies and commerce were the three British advantages that would defeat him in the end.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nNova Scotia and New Brunswick, anonymous, one halfpenny token\nThe copper halfpenny illustrated is perhaps one of the most intriguing Canadian tokens of the early 19th century. Although the piece appears to be of British manufacture, its exact origin remains a mystery. Tokens such as this were usually put into circulation by merchants in order to alleviate chronic shortages of small change.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nNova Scotia, anonymous, penny token 1813\nDuring the early part of the nineteenth century, Halifax was a major British military station as well as a trans-shipment point for supplies being sent from the United States to Europe to help the British in their struggle against Napoleon. This increased commercial activity intensified the port's need for small change, a commodity that had always been in short supply.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nNova Scotia, Miles W. White, one halfpenny token, 1815\nMiles W. White, a native of Shelburne, Nova Scotia, opened a hardware and ironmongery business in Halifax in 1812. His firm was one of several that supplied small copper change to the local inhabitants. These commercial tokens provided the small change necessary to carry on business transactions in a country often beset by shortages of regal coin.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nIn the eighteenth century Nova Scotia received occasional shipments of English pennies and halfpennies. However, after the American Revolution the shipments became fewer, and after 1795 they stopped altogether.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nIn the early days there was a perennial shortage of coins in British North America. To meet this problem Nova Scotia was granted authority in 1823 to issue penny and halfpenny tokens. These coins appeared from 1823 to 1856.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nNova Scotia, Provincial government, penny token, 1856\nAs early as 1823 Nova Scotia had a minor coinage of its own, consisting of penny and halfpenny tokens. At first they bore the bust of George IV on the obverse and a Scottish thistle on the reverse. In 1840 a rather unflattering likeness of Queen Victoria appeared on the obverse, but the thistle remained.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nNew Brunswick, which was originally part of Nova Scotia, was established as a separate colony in 1784. For several decades thereafter, a mixture of foreign coins obtained in trade provided an adequate circulating currency for the new colony.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nNewfoundland, Rutherford Brothers, one halfpenny token, 1846\nNewfoundland, like other parts of British North America, suffered from a chronic shortage of small denomination coins during much of its early history. The British government made no effort to provide a local currency and the islanders had to make do with an insufficient supply of badly worn foreign coins.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nDevins & Bolton, Montreal, Quebec, advertising token, 1863 - 1880\nCounterstamps have long been used on coins and tokens to indicate a change in issuing authority or in value, to convey political statements or simply to advertise a business or its products. The most prolific issuer of counterstamped pieces in 19th century Canada was Devins and Bolton, a firm of chemists and druggists in Montreal.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nSamuel Anckorn, Owen Sound, Ontario, one- shave token 1892\nThe severe shortage of small change that plagued Canada during the 19th century prompted many merchants to issue private tokens. Designed for strictly local use, these tokens passed from hand to hand until redeemed by the issuer for some specific service or commodity or for a discount on a purchase.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nRossland Billiard and Bowling Hall, Rossland, British Columbia, 6 and one-quarter cents, c.1880\nFrom the 1880s until the beginning of the First World War, the merchant's token enjoyed a heyday in Canada, alleviating a general shortage of small change while offering direct advantages to business. Inexpensive to produce, the tokens served as advertising and, in theory at least, were redeemable only in the establishment that issued them.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nRed River and Assiniboine Bridge Co., Winnipeg, Manitoba, two cents, 1898\nMany early Canadian companies and concerns have long since disappeared, leaving behind only the smallest physical indication of their existence or of the nature of their business. The Red River and Assiniboine Bridge Company of Winnipeg is an excellent case in point.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nThe District of Assiniboia was created in the North-West Territories in 1882 and comprised the southern portion of present-day Saskatchewan. The district name was derived from that of the Assiniboin Indians who once inhabited the region.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nBank Tokens\nBanks did more than simply issue paper money. In the 1830s, they began to import large numbers of tokens from England. The Bank of Montreal, for instance, imported both anonymous tokens and tokens stamped with its name. The Banque du Peuple also issued a 1-sou token in Montreal.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nBanque du Peuple, rebellion sou, 1837 (obverse)\nThe chronic shortage of small coins during the first half of the 19th century gave rise to a series of attractive copper tokens known as \"bouquet sous.\" In 1835 the Governor of Lower Canada granted the Bank of Montreal the authority to issue copper tokens of good weight to meet the need for small change.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nBanque du Peuple, rebellion sou, 1837 (reverse)\nIn an effort to alleviate the chronic shortage of small change in Lower Canada in the 1830s, several of the chartered banks were authorized to issue copper sous showing a bouquet of roses, thistles, shamrocks, wheat and maple leaves. The piece illustrated was issued by La Banque du Peuple.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nDuring the first half of the l9th century there was a chronic shortage of small coins in Lower Canada. In 1835, following a government decision to remove all the lightweight pieces from circulation, the shortage became acute.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nBank of Upper Canada, penny token, 1850\nThe Bank of Upper Canada was established in 1821 in York (Toronto, Ontario) under a charter granted by the Province of Upper Canada in 1819. When Upper and Lower Canada were united in 1841 to form the Province of Canada, it was decided that only the bank that held the government accounts should have the right to issue copper tokens.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004\nDevins & Bolton, Victoria, advertising token, 1867\nThe token illustrated is an advertising piece issued by Devins & Bolton, a firm of Montreal druggists. Richard John Devins was born in Montreal in 1837. Although he studied medicine at McGill University, he did not enter practice but rather devoted himself to the study of chemistry and medicine.\nBy Library and Archives Canada | Monday, March 29, 2004"

Its aim is to help readers understand the significant developments affecting First Nations communities from the pre-Contact era (before the arrival of Europeans) up to the present day.\nThe first part of this text —\"Early  First Nations\" — presents a brief overview of the distinctive cultures of the six main geographic groups of early First Nations in Canada. This section looks at the principal differences in the six groups' respective social organization, food resources, homes, modes of transportation, clothing, and spiritual beliefs and ceremonies.\nParts two through six of  this text trace  the relationship between First Nations and newcomers to Canada from the very first encounter up to the government's historic apology in June 2008 to all former students of Indian Residential Schools. In this apology, the Government of Canada expressed deep regret for the suffering individual students and their families experienced because of these schools. The government also acknowledged the harm that residential schools and assimilation policies had done to Aboriginal people's cultures, languages and heritage.\nToday the Government of Canada is working in partnership with First Nations in this new era of reconciliation to build stronger First Nations communities. All across the country, this crucial collaborative work is taking place in areas as diverse as First Nations economies, education, governance, social services, human rights, culture and the resolution of outstanding land claims.\nPart 1 – Early First Nations: The Six Main Geographical Groups\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, First Nations in what is now Canada were able to satisfy all of their material and spiritual needs through the resources of the natural world around them. For the purposes of studying traditional First Nations cultures, historians have therefore tended to group First Nations in Canada according to the six main geographic areas of the country as it exists today. Within each of these six areas, First Nations had very similar cultures, largely shaped by a common environment.\nThe six groups were: Woodland First Nations, who lived in dense boreal forest in the eastern part of the country; Iroquoian First Nations, who inhabited the southernmost area, a fertile land suitable for planting corn, beans and squash; Plains First Nations, who lived on the grasslands of the Prairies; Plateau First Nations, whose geography ranged from semi-desert conditions in the south to high mountains and dense forest in the north; Pacific Coast First Nations, who had access to abundant salmon and shellfish and the gigantic red cedar for building huge houses; and the First Nations of the Mackenzie and Yukon River Basins, whose harsh environment consisted of dark forests, barren lands and the swampy terrain known as muskeg.\nThe following section highlights some of the wide variations in the six groups' social organization, food resources, and homes, modes of transportation and clothing -- as well as spiritual beliefs widely shared by all Early First Nations.\nSocial Organization\nMost Woodland First Nations were made up of many independent groups, each with its own hunting territory. These groups usually had fewer than 400 people. A leader generally won his position because he possessed great courage or skill in hunting. Woodland First Nations hunters and trappers had an intimate knowledge of the habitats and seasonal migrations of animals that they depended on for survival.\nUnlike Woodland First Nations, Iroquoian First Nations did not migrate in search of food. Excellent farmers, these southern peoples harvested annual food crops of corn, beans and squash that more than met their needs. An abundance of food supplies made it possible for the Iroquoian First Nations (now known as the Haudenosaunee, or People of the Longhouse) to found permanent communities and gave them the leisure time to develop complex systems of government based on democratic principles.\nThe Huron-Wendat, for example, had a three-tier political system, consisting of village councils, tribal councils and the confederacy council. All councils made decisions on a consensus basis, with discussions often going late into the night until everyone reached agreement.\nOn the Plains, the individual migratory groups, each with their own chief, assembled during the summer months for spiritual ceremonies, dances, feasts and communal hunts. Even though each group was fiercely independent, Plains First Nations had military societies that carried out functions such as policing, regulating life in camp and on the march, and organizing defences.\nThe social organization of several Plains First Nations was influenced by their neighbours and trading partners—the First Nations of the Pacific Coast. As a result, the Dakelh-ne (Carrier), Tahltan and Ts'ilh'got'in (Chilcotin) adopted the stratified social systems of the Pacific Coast Nations, which included nobles, commoners and slaves.\nIn addition to these three distinct social orders, Pacific Coast First Nations had a well-defined aristocratic class that was regarded as superior by birth. The basic social unit for all First Nations in this part of the country was the extended family (lineage) whose members claimed descent from a common ancestor. Most lineages had their own crests, featuring representations of animal or supernatural beings that were believed to be their founders. The most famous method of crest display was the totem pole consisting of all the ancestral symbols that belonged to a lineage.\nThe people of the Mackenzie and Yukon River Basins lived in a vast homeland where game animals were very scarce and the winters were long and severe. As was true of most First Nations across the country, those of the Mackenzie and Yukon River Basins were primarily occupied with day-to-day survival. As such, First Nations were divided into several independent groups made up of different family units who worked together. Each group hunted a separate territory, with individual boundaries defined by tradition and use. A group leader was selected according to the group's needs at a particular time. On a caribou hunt, for example, the most proficient hunter would be chosen leader.\nFood Resources\nAll First Nations across the country hunted and gathered plants for both food and medicinal purposes. The actual percentage of meat, fish and plants in any First Nation's diet depended on what was available in the local environment.\nThe Woodland First Nations (and all First Nations in the northern regions) hunted game animals with spears and bows and arrows. These First Nations also used traps and snares—a type of noose that caught the animal by the neck or leg. Northern hunters, such as the Gwich'in, built elaborate routing fences with stakes and brush. The Gwich'in used these fences to stampede animals into the area where snares had been set to trap them. To provide for times of hardship, the people dried large stores of meat, fish and berries during the summer. During the winter, to keep frozen meat safe from animals such as the wolverine, some First Nations of the Mackenzie and Yukon River Basins stored their food high in a tree with its trunk peeled of bark.\nEven though the Haudenosaunee had plenty of meat, fish and fowl available to them in the wild, they lived mainly on their own crops—corn, beans and squash, which were called \"The Three Sisters.\" The men cleared the land for planting, chopping down trees and cutting the brush, while the women planted, tended and harvested the crops. After about 10 years, when the land became exhausted, the people would relocate and clear new fertile fields.\nBecause the buffalo was the main object of their hunt, Plains First Nations had a hunting culture that was highly developed over thousands of years. Communal hunts took place in June, July and August when the buffalo were fat, their meat prime and their hides easily dressed.\nA single buffalo provided a lot of meat, with bulls averaging about 700 kilograms. Eaten fresh, the meat was roasted on a spit or boiled in a skin bag with hot stones, a process that produced a rich, nutritious soup. Just as common was the dried buffalo meat known as jerky, which could be stored for a long time in rawhide bags. Women also prepared high-protein pemmican—dried meat pounded into a powder, which was then mixed with hot, melted buffalo fat and berries. A hunter could easily carry this valuable food stuff in a small leather bag. Pemmican later became a staple in the diet of fur traders and voyageurs.\nSalmon was the primary food source for the First Nations of the Plateau. Even the Tahltan hunters of the north assembled each spring at the fishing places to await the arrival of the first salmon. People used dip nets and built weirs in the shallows of swift waters to trap schools of fish. Of the thousands of salmon caught each year, a very small proportion was eaten fresh. The remainder was cleaned, smoked and stored for winter in underground pits lined with birch bark. Wild vegetable foods—chiefly roots and berries—also formed an important part of the diet of the Plateau First Nations, particularly the Interior Salish.\nThe vast food resources of the ocean—salmon, shellfish, octopus, herring, crabs, whale and seaweed—made it possible for Pacific Coast First Nations to settle in permanent locations. Unlike the Haudenosaunee who relocated every 10 years or so, Pacific Coast First Nations usually built permanent villages. Some village sites show evidence of occupation for more than 4,000 years. Like Plateau First Nations, those of the Pacific Coast dried most of their salmon in smokehouses so that it could be stored and eaten later. Fish oil also played an important part in people's diet, serving as a condiment with dried fish during the winter months. A highly valued source of oil was eulachon, a type of smelt.\nThe Coast Tsimshian, Haida and Nuu-chah-nulth all hunted sea lion and sea otter, going out into the ocean with harpoons in slim dugout canoes. However, the most spectacular of all marine hunts was the Nuu-chah-nulth's pursuit of the whale. Nuu-chah-nulth whaling canoes were large enough for a crew of eight and the harpooner, who was armed with a harpoon of yew wood about four metres long and sat directly behind the prow.\nHomes\nBecause of their migratory way of life, First Nations of the Woodland, Plains and Mackenzie and Yukon River Basins all built homes that were either portable or easily erected from materials found in their immediate environments. Woodland and northern peoples' homes were essentially a framework of poles covered with bark, woven rush mats or caribou skin, called tipis.\nPlains First Nations' tipi poles were usually made from long slender pine trees. These were highly valued because replacements were not easy to find on the Prairies. The average tipi cover consisted of 12 buffalo hides stitched together. To prevent drafts and to provide interior ventilation, an inner wall of skins about two metres high was often fastened to the poles on the inside. Women made, erected and owned the tipis.\nUnlike nomadic First Nations, the Haudenosaunee had relatively permanent villages. The longhouse was the most striking feature in an Haudenosaunee village. This structure consisted of an inverted U shape made of poles, which were then covered with slabs of bark. Longhouses were usually about 10 metres wide, 10 metres high and 25 metres long. Each longhouse was headed by a powerful matriarch who oversaw her extended family's day-to-day affairs.\nAmong First Nations of the Plateau, the subterranean homes of the Interior Salish were unlike those of other First Nations in the country. The Interior Salish dug a pit, usually about two metres deep and from six to twelve metres wide, in well-drained soil, typically near a river. This location meant that clean water, fish and a means of transport were all readily accessible. The Interior Salish then covered the pit with a framework of poles and insulated this dwelling with spruce boughs and earth that was removed from the pit. An opening approximately 1.25 metres square was left at the top and served as both the doorway and smoke-hole. People entered the house with the help of steps carved into a sturdy, slanting log, the top of which protruded out of the opening of the pit house.\nMassive forests of red cedar along the Pacific Coast allowed the First Nations who lived in this part of the country to build huge homes. Excellent carpenters, these First Nations used chisels made of stone or shell and stone hammers to split the soft, straight-grained cedar into wide planks. One of the largest traditional homes ever recorded from the pre-contact era was in a Coast Salish village. It was 170 metres long and 20 metres wide. Because Pacific Coast houses were so large, they could accommodate several families, each with its own separate living area and hearth.\nModes of Transportation\nWoodland First Nations constructed birch bark canoes that were light, durable and streamlined for navigating the numerous rivers and lakes in this area. Canoe builders stitched bark sheets together and then fastened them to a wooden frame using watup—white spruce root that had been split, peeled and soaked. The vessel's seams were waterproofed with a coating of heated spruce gum and grease.\nIn the Mackenzie and Yukon River Basins, birch trees did not grow as large as in the southern regions of the country. However, many northern First Nations were able to construct long canoes, using spruce gum to seal the seams between the smaller pieces of bark.\nSome Haudenosaunee also built bark-covered canoes. However, these First Nations mainly travelled by land. Exceptional runners, the Haudenosaunee could cover extremely long distances in a very short time.\nWhen the horse was introduced on the Plains by European explorers around 1700, the peoples of the Plains First Nations readily adapted and became skilled riders. Within 100 years of its introduction, the horse was an essential part of Plains First Nations culture—in hunting, warfare, travel and the transportation of goods. Before that, the principal means of transporting goods and household possessions was the dog and travois—two long poles hitched to a dog's sides, to which a webbed frame for holding baggage was fastened.\nPacific Coast First Nations travelled almost exclusively by water, using dugout canoes made of red cedar. Size varied according to a canoe's function. A small hunting canoe for one or two men would be about five metres long. The Haida built very large canoes. Some Haida canoes were more than 16 metres long and two metres wide, and could carry 40 men and two metric tons of cargo.\nThe actual construction process of a canoe could last three to four weeks and had its own rituals, including prayer and sexual abstinence for the canoe maker. These talented men stretched a canoe hull using a steam-softening process. Water was poured into the hollow and brought to a boil with hot stones. Wooden stretchers were then inserted to hold the sides of the canoe apart while it cooled.\nFor winter travel, all First Nations built some form of snowshoe with a wood frame and rawhide webbing. The shape and size of snowshoes varied due to what sort of terrain was being travelled.\nClothing\nAll First Nations across the country, with the exception of the Pacific Coast, made their clothing—usually tunics, leggings and moccasins—of tanned animal skin. Woodland and northern First Nations used moose, deer or caribou skin. Plains First Nations mostly used light animal skins, such as buffalo, antelope, elk or deer.\nWomen prepared the animal skins and used a smoke tanning process to preserve the hides. Bone needles were used to sew the garments with sinew from the back or legs of a caribou, moose or deer. In winter, people wore robes of fur for extra warmth. Caribou skins were particularly valued by First Nations of the Mackenzie and Yukon River Basins because caribou hair is an excellent insulator.\nWhenever weather permitted, men from Pacific Coast First Nations went unclothed. Coast Tsimshian women wore skirts of buckskin, but elsewhere on the Pacific Coast the women's skirts were woven of cedar bark that had been shredded to produce a soft fibre. Neither men nor women of Pacific Coast First Nations had footwear of any kind. In rainy weather these coastal people wore woven bark rain capes and wide-brimmed hats of woven spruce roots. The Nuu-chah-nulth and Kwakwaka'wakw also made a distinctive long robe woven from yellow cedar bark. Some of these robes were interwoven with mountain goat wool and the most luxurious had borders of sea otter fur.\nAny decorative touches on clothing came from nature. Many Woodland, Haudenosaunee and northern First Nations used dyed porcupine quills to embroider designs on their clothing and moccasins. Men and women coloured their clothing with red, yellow, blue and green dyes derived from flowers, fruits, roots and berries. The men of the Plains First Nations also regularly wore face paint, and a red dye derived from the clay was a very popular colour.\nSpiritual Beliefs\nAll First Nations believed that their values and traditions were gifts from the Creator. One of the most important and most common teachings was that people should live in harmony with the natural world and all it contained.\nIn oral stories and legends that Elders passed from one generation to another, First Nations children learned how the world came into being and that they were a part of the whole of creation. People gave thanks to everything in nature, upon which they depended for survival and development as individuals and as members of their communities. First Nations treated all objects in their environment—whether animate or inanimate—with the utmost respect.\nThis deep respect that First Nations cultivated for every thing and every process in the natural world was reflected in songs, dances, festivals and ceremonies. Among the Woodland First Nations, for example, a hunter would talk or sing to a bear before it died, thanking the animal for providing the hunter and his family with much-needed food.\nIn keeping with their farming culture, the Haudenosaunee held six to eight festivals a year relating to the cultivation of the soil and ripening of fruits and berries. There was a seven-day festival to give thanks when corn was planted, for example, and another when it was green. A third festival was held when corn was harvested.\nFirst Nations of the Pacific Coast had many rituals to give thanks and celebrate the annual salmon run. These rituals included a welcoming ceremony and offerings to the first salmon of the year.\nFor the principles that guided their day-to-day conduct, many First Nations shared value systems similar to the Seven Grandfather Teachings of the Anishnaabe peoples. These teachings stressed Wisdom, Love, Respect, Bravery, Honesty, Humility and Truth as the values that enable people to live in a way that promotes harmony and balance with everyone and everything in creation.\nPart 2 – History of First Nations – Newcomer Relations\nFirst Encounters – Military and Commercial Alliances\n(First Contact to 1763)\nIndigenous peoples occupied North America for thousands of years before European explorers first arrived on the eastern shores of the continent in the 11th century. These newcomers were Norse explorers and settlers, moving ever-westward from Scandinavia to Iceland and Greenland, and eventually to the island of Newfoundland. There they founded North America's first European colony at L'Anse aux Meadows. Although this colony was short-lived, it marked the beginning of European exploration and migration that would radically change the lives of North America's Indigenous peoples.\nEuropean Colonial Settlements and the Fur Trade\nIn the 1500s Europeans returned to the eastern shores of North America to establish settlements. By that time, many Europeans had heard from returning fishermen about the wealth of resources that the New World offered. Attracted by the Grand Banks' teeming cod stocks, Basque, Breton, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Irish and English fishermen had already made contact and traded with the Mik'maq and Maliseet peoples of the Eastern seaboard. As they returned each summer to fish and dry-cure their catch, these fishermen developed an informal trade system with First Nations, exchanging European goods for furs.\nThere was soon a network of competing colonies throughout the Americas as the various European powers pushed to expand their own wealth and influence in this New World. In North America, the British and the French quickly became the dominant powers. By the early 1600s the British had established several colonies and begun settlement on a large scale. The bases of France's North American empire were the colonies of Acadia in the Maritimes and New France in the St. Lawrence Valley.\nSoon after founding these colonies, the two powers cemented alliances with First Nations to support their commercial interests, which included the fur trade. The British allied with the Iroquois Confederacy (now known as the Haudenosaunee, or People of the Longhouse, this group consisted of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca First Nations) and the First Nations of the Allegheny Mountain range. The French allied with First Nations north of the St. Lawrence River (the Huron, Algonquin, Odawa and Montagnais) and in Acadia (the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet and Passamaquoddy). Using the long-established indigenous trade routes of the Interior, the English and French and their First Nations allies developed a vast trade focused on beaver pelts, that spread across North America. This trade spurred new European explorations throughout the Great Lakes basin, into the Prairies and down the Mississippi River.\nMilitary Alliances and Conflict\nFrench and British explorers, fur traders and soldiers followed the trade routes inland. There they established a network of forts and posts to supply their First Nations trading partners and confirm their presence. First Nations quickly adapted to this new commerce, which brought them European goods such as iron wares and firearms. The fur trade was so profitable and important that the various European and First Nations interests often clashed violently throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. Competition between groups such as the Haudenosaunee mentioned above and the Huron resulted in all-out warfare. In the mid-1600s, the Huron were driven from their traditional territories around Georgian Bay.\nIn 1701, this tumultuous era came to an end when France and 40 First Nations signed a treaty in Montreal known as the Great Peace. Through the agreement, the various First Nations in the Great Lakes basin promised to stop violent attacks and to share the lands, as \"a dish with two spoons.\" Moreover, just prior to the Montreal conference, Haudenosaunee leaders had agreed to sell all of the lands of the Great Lakes to the British in exchange for their protection and the continued right to hunt and fish throughout the territory. The Haudenosaunee not only attained a stable peace with the French and its allies, but also secured British protection for their lands and interests.\nAs French and British colonies pushed further inland, their competition for control of the rich Interior of North America became a new theatre of war in the power struggles erupting across Europe. These power struggles, particularly between the British and the French, transformed their respective commercial partnerships with First Nations into vital military alliances that brought much needed support to both camps. Desperate for military assistance ahead of what would turn out to be the final French–British conflict in North America (the Seven Years' War of 1756–1763), British administrators created the Indian Department in 1755 to coordinate alliances with the powerful Haudenosaunee. The new Department also tried to resolve concerns regarding colonial fraud and abuses against First Nations and their lands along the colonial frontier.\nIn 1760, the fall of Montreal—the last French stronghold on the St. Lawrence—put an end to French colonial efforts in what would become Canada. The British victory led to a realignment of the First Nations alliances that had been in place for more than 150 years. Across the former colonies of New France and Acadia, the British undertook a series of treaties to secure the neutrality of First Nations and to establish peaceful relations. In the Maritime region, where lands had been hotly contested since the early 1700s, the British and the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet and Passamaquoddy peoples entered into dozens of these \"Peace and Friendship\" treaties. In 1760, the Aboriginal allies of New France called upon the British to recognize their neutrality in the Seven Years War and concluded the Treaty of Swegatchie and the Murray Treaty.\nAlthough Sir William Johnson, Superintendent of the Indian Department, worked hard at smoothing relations with the sceptical former allies of the French, he was not entirely successful. Shortly after the fall of Montreal, the Odawa leader Pontiac, doubting British intentions and motives, led a series of attacks against British military positions throughout the Great Lakes region. Nevertheless, a combination of military and diplomatic missions enabled Johnson and the Indian Department to establish peaceful, if somewhat uneasy relations with the various First Nations of the Interior.\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763\nThe Treaty of Paris in 1763 ended more than 150 years of European competition and conflict. Through this agreement, France ceded its colonial territories in what is now Canada, including Acadia, New France and the Interior lands of the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. Britain was now the primary European power throughout much of North America, controlling all of the valuable commercial fur trade. Despite this dominance, the British did not fully control the continent. British administrators realized that the success of Britain's North American colonies depended upon stable and peaceful relations with First Nations. To help achieve this, King George III issued a Royal Proclamation in 1763, which specified how the colonies were to be administered. This wide-ranging document established a firm western boundary for the colonies. All the lands to the west of this boundary became \"Indian Territories\" where there could be no settlement or trade without the permission of the Indian Department.\nThe Proclamation established very strict protocols for all dealings with First Nations. From 1763 onward, the Indian Department became the primary point of contact between First Nations and the colonies. In addition, only the Crown could purchase land from a First Nation, which was done by officially sanctioned Crown representatives negotiating with an interested First Nation in a public meeting. All other land purchases were to be considered invalid and were dismissed.\nThe original intent of the Royal Proclamation was to slow the uncontrolled western expansion of the colonies and tightly control the relationship between First Nations and colonists. But crucially, the Proclamation also became the first public recognition of First Nations rights to lands and title .\nPart 3 - A Changing Relationship – From Allies to Wards\n(1763–1862)\nUntil the late 18th century, the relationship between First Nations and the British Crown was still very much based on commercial and military interests. The Indian Department had one primary goal for the British administration throughout the Great Lakes basin—to maintain the peace between the small number of British soldiers and traders stationed at far-flung trading posts and the far more numerous and well-armed First Nations. Under Sir William Johnson's direction, the Indian Department acted as an intermediary between the military and First Nations leaders, securing lands for forts; assuring access to trade, furs and goods; issuing yearly presents; and organizing peace conferences. As Johnson made clear in a letter to the British government, the powerful position of First Nations meant that British commercial interests could only flourish in the Interior if the Crown took definite steps to protect those interests.\nTreaties and a Growing Colony\nThe outbreak of the American War of Independence and Britain's subsequent recognition of the United States of America in 1783 had a dramatic impact on the relationship between the British Crown and its First Nations allies. The loss of the American colonies brought some 30,000 United Empire Loyalist refugees to the remaining British colonies in North America. A powerful group of people who had lost everything because of their support for the British cause, these Loyalists asked colonial administrators for new lands.\nSettlers were not the only refugees from the newly independent United States. First Nations who fought alongside the British were also dispossessed by the war, especially the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy (this group consisted of the Five Nations Confederacy mentioned above, plus the Tuscarora First Nation). Their lands were unilaterally ceded to the Americans by the 1783 Treaty of Versailles. \"His Majesty's Loyal Allies\" from the Iroquois Confederacy were now refugees in Montreal and were asking for compensation for their efforts on the Crown's behalf. In response, officials from the Indian Department negotiated a series of land surrender treaties with the various Anishinaabeg peoples (Odawa, Ojibwa and Algonquin First Nations) inhabiting the lands along the St. Lawrence River and around the Great Lakes. These land surrenders, which largely preceded the arrival of settlers to the area, allowed for the remarkably peaceful establishment of an agricultural colony. To help compensate their First Nations allies for the losses incurred during the war with the Americans, the British Crown set aside two parcels of lands as reserves for the Six Nations—one at the Bay of Quinte and the other along the Grand River.\nIn the last decades of the 18th century, British military leaders and the Indian Department still placed great value on their strong military alliances with First Nations. They feared future conflict with the new American state to the south and saw the numerous First Nations warriors as essential to their colony's defence. The Indian Department worked to bolster the damaged alliances by trying to secure fair deals on land surrenders and by protecting First Nations lands. The Department also issued yearly presents and weaponry during gatherings and conferences with First Nations chiefs and leaders, even those in American territories. These alliances were tested and proved to be strong as war did eventually break out between Britain and its former American colonies. During the War of 1812, First Nations fought alongside the British and Canadian colonists against the American invasion of what is now southern Ontario.\nShifting Relationships\nOnce peace returned to North America, new immigrants and colonists continued to arrive. Less than 50 years after the first land surrenders for settlers in Upper Canada, the non-First Nations population outnumbered the settler population in the Great Lakes basin. To provide land for new settlers' farms, the pace of land surrenders increased. Some 35 sales were concluded, covering all the lands of Upper Canada—from the productive agricultural lands in the south to the natural resource-rich lands of Lake Superior and Georgian Bay.\nAs settlers demanded more and more property, they began to pressure the colonial administration for the lands held by First Nations. Instead of a bastion of colonial defence, the colony's First Nations populations were now regarded as an impediment to growth and prosperity. Not only had military threats to the colonies faded with the end of the War of 1812, but the colonial militia was able to draw on the ever-growing settler population to meet the colony's defensive needs. In the decades following the War of 1812, British administrators therefore began to regard First Nations as dependents, rather than allies.\nBy the 1830s, with more and more lands surrendered for settlement, only pockets of First Nations lands remained in Upper Canada. For the most part, the land surrender treaties did not create sizeable reserves for the First Nations signatories. First Nations thus increasingly lost access to hunting grounds and became a dispossessed people on their former lands. A treaty concluded in 1836 by the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, Sir Francis Bond Head, established Manitoulin Island in Georgian Bay as a reserve for the dispossessed First Nations population. The goal was to encourage these landless peoples to relocate to the island where they would be removed from the more harmful aspects of colonial society (specifically alcohol and prostitution) and where they would adapt to the new colonial reality at a controlled pace. However, few First Nations actually relocated to Manitoulin Island. Most continued to live on small plots of lands set aside by the treaties or on the lands of religious missions trying to convert them to Christianity. Some squatted on Crown Lands, living an increasingly destitute life. Meanwhile, the Crown continued to conclude land surrender treaties with First Nations until 1862.\nAs settlement lands were filled, attention turned for the first time to northern areas where minerals had been discovered along the shores of Lake Superior and Lake Huron. As a result, the Robinson-Huron and Robinson-Superior treaties of the 1850s were negotiated with the various Anishinaabeg peoples inhabiting the area. These two treaties, unlike any previously negotiated treaties, would become the template for future agreements with First Nations in the West. Specifically, the two Robinson treaties ceded First Nations lands and rights to the Crown in exchange for reserves, annuities and First Nations' continued right to hunt and fish on unoccupied Crown lands. This formula to conclude agreements with numerous bands for large tracts of lands would become the model for the Post-Confederation Numbered Treaties .\nThe Hudson's Bay Company\nWhile Britain established its new colony on the St. Lawrence, the Company of Adventurers, better known as the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), continued to trade as it had done since 1670. With an exclusive monopoly and a charter for all the lands of the Hudson Bay watershed, the HBC traded with the First Nations of what is now Northern Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba. In search of rich supplies of furs for the European market, this trade extended along the coasts of the Hudson and James bays. Only peripherally affected by the nearly continuous colonial conflict between France and Britain, the HBC was able to establish a series of posts at strategic major rivers. These early posts, such as Fort Albany and York Factory, became the base for an extensive trade alliance with the Cree. In exchange for a wide variety of goods (knives, kettles, beads, needles and blankets), the Cree traded vast amounts of animal furs from the Interior. As the fur trade grew more lucrative, the Cree became a sort of intermediary between the Company and the Interior groups. They collected furs and pelts from other First Nations hunters and took them to the HBC posts on the coast. Because of the HBC 's monopoly over all trade on lands where the waters flowed into Hudson Bay, this trade relationship proved very profitable for both parties.\nNot all parties, however, were happy with the Company's monopoly over some of the richest fur territories in North America. Following the transfer of New France to the British, French traders based in Montreal began to look for new sources of fur. Several new companies began to challenge the HBC , the most successful being the Northwest Company. Using the system of Interior trading posts and routes established by the French before 1763, the Nor'Westers, as they were known, exploited the lands of the Upper Great Lakes by going out to trade and collect the furs themselves. The Northwest Company, aided by the paddling and hauling skills of French-Canadian, Métis and First Nations voyageurs, went directly to the source of the furs. In this way, they were able to redirect a large quantity of furs away from the Cree intermediaries and the HBC posts far to the north. Using the Ottawa River route from Montreal up to Lake Nippissing and across to Lake Superior, the Northwest Company controlled the bulk of the fur trade heading to Montreal and across to Europe. From their company's primary post, Fort William (near present-day Thunder Bay), the Nor'Westers extended their reach into the vast Prairies of North America.\nBy going into the Interior and trading directly with First Nations hunters, the Northwest Company disrupted the long-standing relationship between the HBC and its Cree intermediaries. Faced with a sharp decline in fur stocks, the HBC governors in London responded by adopting their rival's tactics and abandoning the use of First Nations middlemen. During the first two decades of the 19th century, the HBC and Northwest Company pushed further down the North and South Saskatchewan, the Assiniboine and the Athabasca rivers (among others) in a race to get to First Nations hunters and their fur stocks. This competition not only pitted the traders against each other, but First Nations also joined the fray in an attempt to secure the best prices and goods for their furs. In 1821, after a bloody decade of violence and conflict on the Prairies, the two companies merged into a new and reinvigorated Hudson's Bay Company. The renewed HBC now stretched across the northern half of the continent and held a near total monopoly on trade from the Pacific Coast to Hudson Bay and down to Montreal.\nThis long history of trade, commerce and competition brought about major changes for the First Nations populations of the northern Plains. Above all, the European desire for fur radically transformed Indigenous economies. Rather than small-scale hunting for furs, First Nations were dedicating more and more time and resources to the seemingly endless European demand for animal pelts. The HBC 's desire for bison pelts and pemmican (a type of preserved bison meat popular among traders and voyageurs) transformed the Plains First Nations' buffalo hunt from one of subsistence to extensive commercial exploitation. Trade patterns shifted towards the northern HBC posts and later to the Interior trading posts that were scattered across the Prairies. Traders who had to ship goods down the rivers to central depots such as Fort William hired First Nations men as labourers and porters. All of these activities contributed to a wide-scale diffusion of European goods, especially iron wares, knives and firearms, and to First Nations' dependence on these goods.\nA second major impact of the extended fur trade was increased contact between First Nations, traders and settlers, which would have a dramatic effect on First Nations over the long term. The far-flung and isolated trading posts became gathering places for many groups—not only for trade with the HBC , but also for traders and First Nations themselves. This proximity to traders meant easy access to alcohol, which would have devastating effects on First Nations.\nIn 1812, the Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, the Earl of Selkirk, established a colonial settlement where the Red and Assiniboine rivers meet. Plagued by poor planning and the ongoing conflict between the HBC and the Northwest Company, this initial attempt to organize a colony in the Interior ended in failure. However, a few settlers and Company men did remain in the area and lived in the Interior year-round. Eventually, these people helped form a more established community along the Red River. Decades of intermarriage between HBC traders and voyageurs with First Nation women created a new and distinct Aboriginal group—the Métis—centred at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. This close-knit community merged and adopted European and First Nations customs and lifestyles to meet the needs of the growing frontier settlement.\nPart 4 - Legislated Assimilation – Development of the\nIndian Act\n(1820–1927)\n\"Civilizing the Indian\"\nAs First Nations' military role in the colony waned, British administrators began to look at new approaches to their relationship. In fact, a new perspective was emerging throughout the British Empire about the role the British should play with respect to Indigenous peoples. This new perspective was based on the belief that British society and culture were superior; there was also a missionary fervour to bring British \"civilization\" to the Empire's Indigenous people. In the colonies of Upper and Lower Canada, the Indian Department became the vehicle for this new plan of \"civilization.\" The British believed it was their duty to bring Christianity and agriculture to First Nations. Indian agents accordingly began encouraging First Nations to abandon their traditional lifestyles and to adopt more agricultural and sedentary ways of life. As we now know, these policies were intended to assimilate First Nations into the larger British and Christian agrarian society.\nStarting in the 1820s, colonial administrators undertook many initiatives aimed at \"civilizing\" First Nations. One early assimilation experiment took place at Coldwater-Narrows, near Lake Simcoe in Upper Canada. A group of Anishinaabe were encouraged to settle in a typical colonial-style village where they would be instructed in agriculture and encouraged to adopt Christianity and abandon hunting and fishing as a means of subsistence. But because of poor management by the Indian Department, chronic underfunding, a general lack of understanding of First Nations cultures and values, and competition between various religious denominations, the Coldwater-Narrows experiment was short-lived and a dismal failure.\nIndian Legislation\nDespite initial problems, the \"civilization\" program was to remain one of the central tenets of Indian policy and legislation for the next 150 years. One of the first such pieces of legislation was the\nCrown Lands Protection Act\nof 1876 was a consolidation of previous regulations pertaining to First Nations. The\nAct\ngave greater authority to the federal Department of Indian Affairs. The Department could now intervene in a wide variety of internal band issues and make sweeping policy decisions, such as determining who was an Indian. Under the\nAct\n, the Department would also manage Indian lands, resources and moneys; control access to intoxicants; and promote \"civilization.\" The\nIndian Act\nwas based on the premise that it was the Crown's responsibility to care for and protect the interests of First Nations. It would carry out this responsibility by acting as a \"guardian\" until such time as First Nations could fully integrate into Canadian society.\nThe\nIndian Act\nis one of the most frequently amended pieces of legislation in Canadian history. It was amended nearly every year between 1876 and 1927. The changes made were largely concerned with the \"assimilation\" and \"civilization\" of First Nations. The legislation became increasingly restrictive, imposing ever-greater controls on the lives of First Nations. In the 1880s, the government imposed a new system of band councils and governance, with the final authority resting with the Indian agent. The\nAct\ncontinued to push for the whole-scale abandonment of traditional ways of life, introducing outright bans on spiritual and religious ceremonies such as the potlatch and sun dance.\nThe concept of enfranchisement (the legal act of giving an individual the rights of citizenship, particularly the right to vote) also remained a key element of government policy for decades to come. As very few First Nations members opted to become enfranchised, the government amended the\nAct\nto enable automatic enfranchisement. An 1880 amendment, for example, declared that any First Nations member obtaining a university degree would be automatically enfranchised. An 1933 amendment empowered the government to order the enfranchisement of First Nations members meeting the qualifications set out in the\nAct\n, even without such a request from the individuals concerned. In 1927, the government added yet another new restriction to the\nAct\n. In response to the Nisga'a pursuit of a land claim in British Columbia, the federal government passed an amendment forbidding fundraising by First Nations for the purpose of pursuing a land claim without the expressed permission of the Department of Indian Affairs. This amendment effectively prevented First Nations from pursuing land claims of any kind.\nIndian Education and Residential Schools\nIn 1883, Indian Affairs policy on First Nations education focused on residential schools as a primary vehicle for \"civilization\" and \"assimilation\". Through these schools, First Nations children were to be educated in the same manner and on the same subjects as Canadian children (reading, writing, arithmetic and English or French). At the same time, the schools would force children to abandon their traditional languages, dress, religion and lifestyle. To accomplish these goals, a vast network of 132 residential schools was established across Canada by the Catholic, United, Anglican and Presbyterian churches in partnership with the federal government. More than 150,000 Aboriginal children attended residential schools between 1857 and 1996.\nPart 5 - New Perspectives – First Nations in Canadian Society\n(1914–1982)\nDespite decades of difficult and painful living conditions for First Nations under the restrictive regulations of the\nIndian Act\n, many First Nations answered the call to arms during both World Wars and the Korean War. Approximately 6,000 Aboriginal soldiers from across Canada served in the First World War alone. By the late 1940s, social and political changes were underway that would mark the start of a new era for First Nations in Canada. Several First Nations leaders emerged, many of them drawing attention to the fact that thousands of their people had fought for their country in both World Wars. First Nations across the country began to create provincially based organizations that forcefully expressed their peoples' desire for equality with other Canadians, while maintaining their cultural heritage.\nRolling Back Paternalism\nIn 1946, a special joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and the House of Commons undertook a broad review of Canada's policies and management of Indian affairs. For three years, the committee received briefs and representations from First Nations, missionaries, school teachers and federal government administrators. These hearings brought to light the actual impact of Canada's assimilation policies on the lives and well-being of First Nations. The committee hearings were one of the first occasions at which First Nations leaders and Elders were able to address parliamentarians directly instead of through the Department of Indian Affairs. First Nations largely rejected the idea of cultural assimilation into Canadian society. In particular, they spoke out against the enforced enfranchisement provisions of the\nIndian Act\nand the extent of the powers that the government exercised over their daily lives. Many groups asked that these \"wide and discretionary\" powers be vested in First Nations chiefs and councillors on reserves so that they themselves could determine the criteria for band membership and manage their own funds and reserve lands. While the joint committee did not recommend a full dismantling of the\nIndian Act\nand its assimilationist policies, it did recommend that unilateral and mandatory elements of the Act be scaled back or revised. The committee also recommended that a Claims Commission be established to hear problems arising from the fulfilment of treaties.\nDespite the committee's recommendations, amendments to the\nIndian Act\nin 1951 did not bring about sweeping changes to the government's Indian policy, nor did it differ greatly from previous legislation. Contentious elements of the\nAct\nsuch as the involuntary enfranchisement clause were repealed, as were the provisions that determined Indian status . However, the amendments did introduce some changes. For example, sections of the\nAct\nbanning the potlatch and other traditional ceremonies, as well as a ban on fundraising to pursue land claims, were repealed. Bands were also given more control over the administration of their communities and over the use of band funds and revenues. National pension benefits and other health and welfare benefits were to be extended to First Nations. While the 1951\nAct\ndid limit some of the authority of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development over individual bands, the government continued to exercise considerable powers over the lives of First Nations.\nDespite the fact that the\nIndian Act\nstill limited First Nations' control over their own affairs, by 1960 social and economic conditions on reserve began to improve. That year First Nations were at long last extended the right to vote in federal elections, another recommendation of the 1946 joint committee. First Nations veterans played a big role in this important advance, pointing out that, despite having fought for Canada in two World Wars, they were still deprived the right to vote. Other improvements for First Nations included the provision of better healthcare services in the mid-1950s. With these improvements, the Status Indian population increased rapidly. In addition, many more First Nations children had access to schooling, including secondary and post-secondary education. In general, however, the living conditions of First Nations still fell far short of the standards of other Canadians.\nThe White Paper\nIn 1969, the government began to examine a radically new approach to its Indian policy. This approach was based on the view that all Canadians held the same rights regardless of ethnicity, language or history. Arguing that the \"special status\" of First Nations and Inuit had put them at a disadvantage, and that both of these groups should be fully integrated into Canadian society, the government tabled a policy paper commonly known as the\nWhite Paper\nas paternalistic and coercive, the\nAct\nnevertheless protected special Aboriginal status within Confederation and therefore specific rights. In the face of such strong negative reaction not only from First Nations, but also from the general public, the government withdrew the\nWhite Paper\nin 1971. The government's attempt to change its relationship with First Nations created a new form of Aboriginal nationalism. First Nations leaders from across the country united in new associations and organizations determined to protect and promote their peoples' rights and interests. These organizations proposed their own policy alternatives. The Indian Association of Alberta, for example, argued in a paper entitled\nCitizens Plus\nthat Aboriginal peoples held rights and benefits that other Canadians did not. Rallying around this concept, First Nations leaders argued that their people were entitled to all the benefits of Canadian citizenship, in addition to special rights deriving from their unique and historical relationship with the Crown.\nThe federal government slowly began to change its approach and scale back its paternalistic presence in the lives of First Nation, for example, by withdrawing all Indian agents from reserves. The government also began to fund Aboriginal political organizations. This funding allowed these groups to focus on the need for full recognition of their Aboriginal rights and the renegotiation of existing treaties.\nComprehensive Land Claims\nAs First Nations organizations such as the National Indian Brotherhood (later the Assembly of First Nations) increasingly challenged the government's Indian policy, the courts also began to weigh in on the issue. In the early 1970s, three landmark court decisions brought about an important shift in the recognition of the rights of First Nations in Canada. In Northern Quebec, a proposed hydro-electric project in the James Bay region announced in 1971 became a focal point for Cree and Inuit protests. Arguing that the lands of Northern Quebec were not covered by any existing treaties and that they still held Aboriginal rights over those lands, the Cree Nation and Inuit of Northern Quebec filed for an injunction to block the project until their claim of rights and title was addressed. In an unprecedented decision in Canadian law, in 1973 the Superior Court of Quebec ruled in favour of the Cree and Inuit, deciding that there remained an unfulfilled obligation to resolve Aboriginal title in Northern Quebec.\nThat same year, the courts once again brought the issue of First Nations claims under public scrutiny. After decades of persistence, the Nisga'a people in British Columbia succeeded in bringing their case before the Supreme Court of Canada. Led by Frank Calder, the Nisga'a argued that Aboriginal title to lands was part of Canadian law. In their 1973 decision in the\nCalder case\n, six of the seven Supreme Court justices ruled in favour of the Nisga'a, confirming the legality of Aboriginal title. In a third court case in 1973, the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories ruled in what has become known as the Paulette Caveat that Canada had not fulfilled its obligations under the terms of Treaties 8 and 11 in the Territories. As such, Aboriginal rights and title could not be fully relinquished to the Crown.\nA review of these three monumental court decisions led the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (now Aboriginal Affairs and  Northern Development Canada or AANDC)  to announce its willingness to negotiate land claims based on outstanding Aboriginal title. The Department's new Comprehensive Claims Policy , the aim of which was to settle land claims through a negotiated process, was announced in August 1973. Through this new policy, Aboriginal rights and title would be transferred to the Crown by an agreement that guaranteed defined rights and benefits for the signatories (i.e. land title, fishing and trapping rights, financial compensation and other social and economic benefits). The first agreement under this new policy was with the Cree and Inuit of Northern Quebec. Soon after the 1972 James Bay ruling, the Cree, Inuit and the federal and Quebec governments began negotiations in an attempt to settle Aboriginal claims and allow the hydro-electric development project to resume. Under the final agreement signed in November 1975, the concerned Cree and Inuit groups surrendered their Aboriginal title to about 981,610 square kilometres of the James Bay/Ungava territory in Northern Quebec. In return, these parties were awarded a $225-million settlement, to be paid over 20 years. The Cree and Inuit also received tracts of community lands with exclusive hunting and trapping rights, the establishment of a new system of local government on lands set aside for their use, and First Nations control over their education and health authorities. In addition, the agreement set out measures relating to policing and the administration of justice, continuing federal and provincial benefits, and special social and economic development measures.\nSince 1975, the Comprehensive Claims Policy has been modified in response to Aboriginal concerns and positions. Most notably, new options were added in 1986 relating to the transfer of rights and title (as well as a broader scope of rights and other issues). A cap on the number of ongoing negotiations was lifted in 1991.\nThe negotiation of comprehensive claims is a long and painstaking process, requiring many years to complete. From 1975 to 2009, there were 22 comprehensive claims agreements, commonly known as \"modern treaties,\" concluded across Northern Quebec, the Northwest Territories, Yukon and British Columbia. Two of the most important agreements concluded are the Nunavut and Nisga'a agreements. Signed in 1993, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement was the first treaty with Inuit in Canada and laid the groundwork for the creation of the Territory of Nunavut on April 1st, 1999. One year earlier in British Columbia, after over a century of claims and 24 years of negotiation, the Nisga'a Agreement was ratified by the Nisga'a, Canada and the province of British Columbia. The Nisga'a Final Agreement of 2000 was the first modern treaty in British Columbia.\nSpecific Claims Policy\nAs part of the wider review of how Canada dealt with First Nations claims, AANDC created a companion policy to Comprehensive Claims that addressed claims of a more specific nature. While the idea of addressing specific First Nations claims was first proposed in the 1948 joint committee report, it was not acted upon until 1973. From this point forward the Comprehensive Claims Policy would deal with issues stemming from claims to Aboriginal title, whereas the Specific Claims Policy addressed claims relating to the failure to fulfill any \"lawful obligations\" flowing from the\nIndian Act\nor existing treaties. To accompany the policy, the Office of Native Claims was created to guide claims through the process. However, the claims process proved difficult and cumbersome, leading many First Nations to complain it was ineffective and inefficient. After amendments to the policy in the mid-1980s and again in the early 1990s, the government created the Indian Specific Claims Commission to review AANDC 's decisions regarding claims and to make recommendations.\nWhile these changes to the policy did allow for more claims to be addressed, the complexity, volume and diversity of the claims were increasingly difficult to manage. Lengthy delays were common. In 2006, the Senate Standing Committee on Aboriginal Peoples recommended that the government establish a dedicated fund for the payment of specific claims settlements and an independent body with a mandate and power to resolve specific claims. In response, AANDC invited First Nations organizations to become directly involved in formulating the new Specific Claims Policy. As a result, in 2008 the\nSpecific Claims Tribunal Act\ncreated an independent adjudicative tribunal with the authority to make binding decisions on the validity of claims and on compensation.\n\"Existing Aboriginal and Treaty Rights\"\nThe federal government entered into constitutional discussions with provincial premiers between 1977 and 1981 to reform and repatriate the Constitution. Aboriginal political organizations tried unsuccessfully to get a seat at the negotiations table. When a 1981 constitutional proposal was announced, Aboriginal and treaty rights were excluded. However, after several months of concerted lobbying, First Nations, Inuit and Métis organizations succeeded in having two clauses included in Section 35 of the Constitution, to recognize \"existing Aboriginal and treaty rights \" and to provide a definition of Aboriginal peoples that included all three groups. At conferences held between 1983 and 1987, attempts were made to define \"existing Aboriginal and treaty rights.\" However, those rights remained undefined because of disagreements between the provinces, Canada and Aboriginal groups. Given this lack of consensus on a clear definition of \"existing Aboriginal and treaty rights,\" responsibility has fallen to the courts to define the extent and scope of these rights and to direct government policies and programs so that they respect these rights and prevent any infringement of them.\nPart 6 - Towards a New Relationship\n(1982 – present)\nBill C-31\nSince the mid-1800s, government policy had dictated that First Nations women automatically lost their Indian \"status\" if they married non-Aboriginal men. This automatic enfranchisement was entrenched in successive legislation for more than a century. For decades, many First Nations members, especially women, criticized this section of the\nIndian Act"

    "content": "Hudson’s Bay Company | Canada Alive!\nEverything you wanted to know, and the stuff you didn't, about Canada.\nHudson’s Bay Company\nby Canada Alive! 🍁\nThe oldest company in North America is Hudson’s Bay Company, established by Royal Charter in 1670 and still in operation today. HBC, or “The Bay”, is responsible for a large part of the settlement of western Canada, and was one of the primary investors in both a cross-country railroad and the expansion of the Northwest Mounted Police. HBC trading forts have fended off invaders and secured supply lines in the most wild regions, helping the shape the destiny of this country over 344 years!\nToday HBC owns The Bay upscale department stores, Home Outfitters, Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue. The company has stalled its expansion in recent years as it weathers the recession and consolidates its share of the retail market, but it has managed to avoid costly mass layoffs and bankruptcy, the fate that met many of its competitors in 2008-2009. After 344 years, however, the odd financial recession is nothing to worry this giant of Canada’s retail landscape.\nIn 1670 a group of English investors asked King Charles II to grant them a charter to explore and set up a fur trading colony around the Hudson Bay region (today’s Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec). The King accepted, with 2% royalties going to the Crown, and the Hudson’s Bay Company was founded. At the time, with the annexation of the entire Hudson’s Bay region, the company became the single biggest landowner in the world. The HBC set up its operations at York Factory, on the Manitoba shores of the bay, and from there set out to monopolize the entire North American fur trade.\nIn the first 50 years, HBC established six trading forts around “Rupert’s Land”, the region surrounding Hudson’s Bay. French trappers and native First Nations did most of the trapping, bringing beaver, fox, wolf and bear furs to the various trading forts for payment. The forts would cure and store the furs and then once a year transport them to York Factory where they would be loaded onto a fleet of ships bound for England. These furs found their way across Europe and even to the Middle East, India and China! HBC reaped awesome profits with this lucrative fur trade, and with armed garrisons, highly-organized tranport networks and cut-throat prices were able to squeeze the French out of the fur industry altogether. The Hudson’s Bay Company, by the middle of the 18th Century, dominated the entire global fur trade.\nPrince of Wales Fort, an HBC fort in western Manitoba.\nNative trappers and Hudson’s Bay Company buyers negotiate at an HBC fort.\nIn the middle of the 18th Century the Hudson’s Bay Company embarked on a program of aggressive expansion. The French defeat in the 7 Years’ War and the expulsion of the British from the 13 colonies following the American Revolution left a vacuum in the Canadas, of which HBC was only too happy to fill. The Treaty of Ultrecht, which ended French claims on North America, ceded all French commercial and military installations to the Hudson’s Bay Company. The French had spent two centuries exploring the continent and establishing trade routes for its fur industry. With one fell swoop, HBC acquired the entire lot.\nHBC also changed its purchasing format to better profit from Native trappers. Instead of paying in cash or kind, they established the “wool blanket points” system, whereby HBC traded in signature wool blankets for pelts. Each blanket had a number of indigo stripes woven into them, which indicated its size and value. This allowed HBC to keep amazing profits and lower its overhead while exploiting the native labour force without them even being aware of it.\nIn 1779 HBC went public on the Montreal stock exchange, partly in response to its main competitor, the Northwest Company’s public offering. Although it is debated which company started offering stock first, the fact of the matter is that HBC is the oldest publicly-traded company in North America today.\nBy 1822 HBC had merged with its rival and was granted territorial rights to all of western Canada. The pre-established trade routes blazed by French explorers were exploited and a series of trading forts were set up all over the west. Some of these forts would go on to become bustling Canadian cities, like Fort Edmonton, Fort Victoria and Fort Vancouver.\nHBC blanket with its signature indigo stripes.\nThe “Golden Square Mile” in downtown Montreal was the site of Canada’s first stock exchange, where HBC first went public in the late 18th Century.\nFort Edmonton, site of present-day downtown Edmonton, Alberta.\nFort Victoria, BC\nFort Vancouver\nBy the middle of the 19th Century the Hudson’s Bay Company controlled the entire fur trade on the Pacific North West and was heavily involved in the Asian markets. Their western headquarters, at Fort Vancouver, was growing into a bustling port with tertiary industries springing up all around the old wooden fort. City streets were built, warehouses and shops sprung up and a housing boom ensued as thousands of people flocked to the new city to capitalize on the HBC trade to Asia.\nTo keep the trade alive and to integrate their far-flung empire, HBC heavily lobbied the new “Government of Canada” in 1867 to build a railroad across the country. HBC invested more than $50 million (about $2 billion today) into the Canada-Pacific railway and even supplied materials and labour. As cities sprung up around forts and the company invested in railroads, bridges and roads, HBC turned from a private enterprise into a nation builder.  HBC was so influential in settling Canada’s west, in fact, that the government in Ottawa created the Northwest Mounted Police (today’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police) in part to protect HBC assets in the wild territories!\nBy the middle of the 19th Century HBC had more than 100,000 employees, 274 ocean-going ships, more than 1,000 soldiers under contract and had 7 board members serving as Members of Parliament in both Canada and Britain! It was the largest and most influential company in the British Empire, and was worth a staggering $1 billion (more than $500 billion today).\nIn 1869 the US government offered to purchase HBC for $10 million, an offer the company rightfully refused. It is unsure why the US government offered so little for such a large company, but ignorance of the true extent of HBC’s worth, as well as a touch of arrogance on the part of US traders, most definitely played a part.\nInstead of selling to the Americans, HBC sold Rupert’s Land, which it had owned for 200 years, back to the British Crown for $12 million. Queen Victoria then gifted the land to the Canadian government, who then leased the land back to the HBC at cut-rate prices. HBC made huge profits from this single transaction and was able to expand into realms it had so far left alone: retail.\nBy the 1870’s HBC owned more than 270 ocean-going ships, many of them the most modern design of the times.\nHBC established its first retail store in Langley, BC in 1859. It’s main purpose was to sell general-store items to this small mining town, but the operation grew to include fashions and new-fangled appliances. Realizing successful profits, the company opened stores in Victoria, Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary and Nelson. At first called “Hudson’s Bay Company Store”, the name was shortened to just “The Bay” and a Canadian retail giant was born.\nThe First World War interrupted HBC retail expansion, and it also severely crippled HBC shipbuilding as all new designs and new ships went to the war effort. In 1917 HBC sold off the remainder of its fleet and decided to concentrate on its retail and traditional fur operations.\nAfter the war, in the early 1920’s, the company entered the new oil and gas industry. Always on the forefront of expansion, HBC founded Hudson’s Bay Oil and Gas (HBOG), which became the fourth largest petroleum supplier in North America until the 1980’s when the company sold all its oil assets to Dome Petroleum amid the gas crisis hysteria.\nThe Bay store in Toronto was established in 1870 and is one of the oldest department stores still operating in Canada today.\nThe Bay Montreal\nThe 20th Century was a time of great change for HBC. The demand for furs had all but dried up by the time of the Second World War, and HBC fur trade and forts were only operating in northern Canada. Oil and gas were bringing in profits, and the Bay dabbled a little in the diesel train industry before selling off its assets there. The company instead turned to retail, and with more and more department stores opening, it became the main importer of fashions and accessories to the country.\nHBC buyers scoured the runways of Paris and New York for the latest fashions, and travelled the world looking for the finest perfumes, and signed big deals with General Electric for home appliances. The result was that The Bay became known across Canada for being the place to shop for the latest and greatest of products. Fashion, appliances, furniture, decor, dishware, linens and cosmetics were all added to The Bay’s offerings. As more and more stores opened, the company became a giant in the retail industry.\nIn 1974 the company relocated its head office from Winnipeg to Toronto, building the Simpson Tower to house its various departmental offices. It also purchased the Shop-Rite chain of stores and in 1978 HBC purchased the Zeller’s chain of discount department stores. The Bay also purchased Simpsons and folded them into The Bay chain of stores. In 1978 The Bay made a bid to purchase US giant Sears, but was turned down. Instead HBC gained a significant share of Sears Canada operations.\nBy 1981 The Bay was a household name across Canada, but it was facing a serious debt problem. To balance its books and pay off debtors, the Bay sold off its oil and gas subsidiary, sold off any remaining rail and port assets it owned, and closed down the last of its 300-year fur trade operations in the Yukon. This allowed HBC to settle its debts but transformed the company into a retail-only enterprise. A history of innovation and aggressive expansion, however, would be brought to the highly-competitive retail market.\nIn the late 1990’s The Bay established Winner’s, a chain of discount clothing stores. In 2000 it set up Home Sense, a home design chain.\nIn 2006 HBC finally sold to the Americans, when billionaire Jerry Zucker offered to purchase the company for $15.25 per share. The resulting sale of North America’s oldest company for $1.1 billion shocked the retail world, but nothing changed with HBC. The company retained all its assets, its head office was still based in Toronto, and its original 1670 Charter was still proudly displayed in the lobby. All Jerry Zucker did was rake in the profits from this retail giant.\nIn 2013, in another shocking move, HBC purchased Saks Incorporated for $2.9 billion, giving the company a huge presence in the United States.\nToday The Bay is going strong. Its stores are still operating and the company is still churning a profit. After 344 years in business, North America’s oldest company is still looking good.\nThe Bay store in Calgary, circa 1930\nThe Bay is headquartered in the Simpson Tower in downtown Toronto.\nThe Bay today is still a premium shopping brand found in every Canadian city.\nThe Bay is known for its extensive cosmetics department, and specializes in perfumes from around the world.\nFashion, beginning with the fur trade in 1670, has always been a staple of The Bay.\nThe Bay blends a sense of its history together with modernity to create interesting stores.\nHBC has established WInners discount clothing stores across Canada’s suburban strip malls.\nHome Sense is another HBC company that can be found across the country.

    "content": "Red River Colony - The Canadian Encyclopedia\nIndigenous People\nRed River Colony\nThe Red River Colony, a key part of Manitoba's rich history, was a settlement on the Red and Assiniboine rivers whose boundaries crossed parts of what are now Manitoba and North Dakota.\nThe Red River Colony, a key part of Manitoba 's rich history, was a settlement on the Red and Assiniboine rivers whose boundaries crossed parts of what are now Manitoba and North Dakota. Founded in 1812 by Thomas Douglas , 5th Earl of Selkirk, the colony grew through times of extreme hardship into a multiracial society. It was the site of the Red River Resistance before reluctantly joining Canada as the province of Manitoba.\nEstablishing the Red River Colony\nSince 1801 the Earl of Selkirk had sought British support for a settlement in the region occupied by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), but it was not until he and his family had gained control of the company in 1810 that his scheme became practical. In 1811, the HBC granted Selkirk some 300,000 km2 of the land it had claimed in the Winnipeg Basin, which he called Assiniboia . Under Miles MacDonell , Selkirk's choice as governor, an advance party was sent from Scotland to Hudson Bay in July 1811 and finally arrived on the Red River on 29 August 1812. A second group joined them in October. MacDonell established his base near the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers (now downtown Winnipeg ) with a subsidiary centre 130 km south at Pembina (North Dakota).\nThe settlers had difficulty becoming self-sufficient, and only the assistance of resident North West Company traders and local freemen enabled them to survive. Naturally bellicose and fearing that new settlers would strip the area of food supplies, MacDonell attempted to monopolize the region's provision trade through the Pemmican Proclamation of 8 January 1814, by which he prohibited the export of provisions from the region. This threat to the NWC's transcontinental transportation system — which took provisions, especially pemmican , from the area to supply its canoe brigade — led the Nor'Westers and their Métis allies to retaliate. In early 1815, the Nor'Westers enticed many colonists back to Canada by promising better land. MacDonell was arrested, the remaining inhabitants withdrew, and the settlement was burned.\nLater that year the colony was reoccupied under Colin Robertson, and Robert Semple replaced MacDonell as governor. Continual complaint with the North West Company (a commercial fur trade competitor with the Hudson's Bay Company) led in 1816 to the violent Seven Oaks incident and the killing of Semple, after which the Nor'Westers again evacuated the colony. Meanwhile, Selkirk had recruited new settlers among the De Meurons , discharged mercenary soldiers, and was leading this group to Red River when he learned of Seven Oaks.\nOn 13 August he seized the NWC's Fort William , which lay on his route, and on 10 January 1817 sent a force to retake Fort Douglas. When Selkirk finally arrived that July, he distributed land and restored the settlers' confidence, promising them schools and clergymen. Roman Catholic priests arrived in 1818, but not until 1820 did a Protestant missionary come, and John West was Anglican rather than Gaelic-speaking Presbyterian, a source of grievance to the Scots settlers for years.\nDevastation and Growth\nAfter 1817, the environment became the major threat to the infant colony. Locusts devastated the crops in 1818 and 1819, and the greatest known flood of the Red River virtually destroyed the settlement in 1826. After Selkirk's death in 1820, his executors administered the colony and sought to reduce expenses by ending settlers' subsidies and refusing to recruit new European immigrants. Population growth came largely through the retirement to the colony of fur traders and their Aboriginal families. On 4 May 1836, Assiniboia was transferred to the HBC by Selkirk's family.\nThe colony's population grew slowly but steadily, composed largely of people with mixed European and Aboriginal blood (francophone Metis and anglophone \"country born\"). Despite continual conflicts over language, religion and class, a promising multiracial society developed. The roots of its problems were economic, because of the colony's isolation. The HBC attempted to control commerce, although its limitations were made clear by the HBC's prosecution in 1849 of Pierre-Guillaume Sayer for illicit fur trading (see Sayer Trial ). The outcome was, in effect, free trade for the Métis.\nPerhaps equally critical was the inability of the colony to provide suitable employment for an increasingly literate population, leading the younger generation to become extremely restive. In the wake of Confederation , arrangements were made to transfer the colony and the vast neighbouring territory of Rupert's Land to Canada, yet without either consultation with the colony's inhabitants or any guarantees of their political or property rights. That set the stage for the Red River Resistance , after which the colony was reluctantly admitted to Canada as the province of Manitoba, in 1870, with boundaries limited to the existing areas of settlement north of the 49th parallel.\nW.L.

It boasts magical coasts, majestic mountains, wild rivers, untrod forests, and untouched lakes. It also boasts sky-scraping cities, sophisticated shopping, and culinary delights. From the Calgary Stampede to the Shakespearean Festival, from ethnic festivals to the changing of the guard in Ottawa, Canada is a fascinating blend of English and French, historic and modern, ceremonial and casual.\nCanada has always had close ties with the United States, as evidenced by the fact that the two countries share the longest unguarded border in the world. In spite of its extensive geographical, cultural, financial, and economic ties with the U.S., however, Canada retains a unique distinction from its southern neighbors.\nMAJOR CITIES\nOttawa\nOttawa (from an Indian word meaning \"near the water\") is a clean, attractive, modern city at the junction of the Ottawa, Rideau, and Gatineau Rivers, about 60 miles north of the New York State border and 120 miles west of Montreal. City residents total over 400,000, and the total metropolitan population is over one million. The climate is healthful and bracing, and the area abounds with opportunities for outdoor activities and family living.\nSamuel de Champlain reached the site of what is now Ottawa in 1613; however, a permanent settlement did not develop until after the Rideau Canal was built in 1827. Originally named Bytown, Ottawa was incorporated as a city under its present name in 1854. It was selected as the national capital by Queen Victoria in 1888.\nAs Canada's capital, Ottawa's main business is government and, as in Washington, DC, little industry exists. Living conditions are similar to those in comparably sized U.S. cities, although social life is geared to demands of diplomatic and government circles.\nSmall Oriental, Lebanese, Portuguese, and Italian colonies exist in Ottawa, but the majority of residents are of British or French descent. Most francophones (35% of the population) are also fluent in English. Approximately 15,000 Americans live in the Ottawa district; they have merged into the population and do not constitute a discernible American colony. About 50 U.S. companies have subsidiaries or affiliates in the area, but only a few have American citizens on their local staffs.\nDuring summer, there is a flow of U.S. tourists through the city, and all year government officials and business representatives visit Ottawa in their respective roles.\nThe diplomatic community is large and growing. Some 146 nations maintain relations with Canada, although only 100 have resident missions in Ottawa. Most are small, with two or three officers and a chief of mission. The only large missions are those of the U.S., U.K., Russia,   France, Germany, and the People's Republic of China.\nEducation\nOttawa's public school system offers instruction from kindergarten through grade 13. There are 55 elementary schools for kindergarten through grade eight, and 15 high schools with English instruction and five with French instruction, both covering grades 9 to 13. Tuition is free for Ottawa residents attending public schools. Children may enter kindergarten at age five, or four if the child will be five before December 31 of that year.\nCourses meet the standards established by the Ontario Ministry of Education. The teacher-student ratio in elementary schools is about 1:16, and in secondary schools about 1:12, ratios which have remained constant for several years.\nParents may place their children in one of two language programs: the immersion program consisting of instruction totally in French in the first few years, and a gradual phasing in of English instruction until the program becomes bilingual; or the core program consisting of at least 20 minutes daily of French instruction from kindergarten through eighth grade and making it optional at some level after that. The core program is not a rigid one and may vary from school to school.\nWhile some students coming from U.S. schools have found the Ottawa high schools somewhat less demanding than their own, most students and parents report few differences or problems. Instructional programs and course offerings vary from school to school within a particular area.\nStudents pursuing a commercial, technical, or vocational curriculum in high school can receive a diploma after grade 12. Those planning to continue their studies beyond high school, especially if applying for admission to colleges and universities in Ontario, have, until recently, been required to complete grade 13, but this proviso is currently being phased out.\nThe Roman Catholic Church maintains a \"separate school\" system in Ottawa composed of 42 primary schools (19 with French instruction, 23 with English); six intermediate schools (five with French instruction, one with English); and two junior high schools, all with English instruction. Tuition through grade 10 is free for Ottawa residents. The curriculum of the \"separate schools\" meets all the requirements of the Ontario Ministry of Education.\nThe schools located in the suburban areas of Ottawa come under either the Carleton Public or Carleton Roman Catholic School Boards. Tuition for schools in both systems is free for residents of the school district. The Carleton Public School Board has 60 elementary schools (including 28 offering French immersion). There are 16 high schools, grades nine through 13, including several with a French immersion program. In addition to the schools offering French immersion, many schools in the Carleton jurisdiction offer French instruction similar to the Ottawa Board's core program. As with the Ottawa Board, parents are advised to check with the school in their neighborhood for specific details regarding the French program.\nThe Carleton Roman Catholic School Board has 51 elementary schools (32 with English instruction, 19 with French), all of which provide kindergarten to grade eight, and five high schools, grades nine through 13. However, after grade 10, the schools are considered private and tuition must be paid by parents. Many English-instruction elementary schools have French programs similar to those offered in the public school system. For details, parents should check with the neighborhood school their children will attend. The Carleton Roman Catholic School Board has no high schools where the language of instruction is French.\nAs in the Ottawa public and separate school boards, the curriculum in both boards in Carleton meets all the requirements of the Ontario Ministry of Education.\nWhile a few American families live in Quebec Province (across the Ottawa River in the greater Hull area), the U.S. Embassy strongly discourages families with school-age children from residing in Quebec. The volatile French-language  issue and related educational controversies, plus frequent teachers' strikes, have created considerable turmoil in the schools. Children not already reasonably conversant in French will probably encounter problems, especially at the high school level, even if enrolled in an English-language school.\nQuebec Province requires all high school students to take French throughout high school and to pass a standard provincial French-language examination before graduation.\nBoth public and separate school systems in Ottawa and the suburban areas offer extracurricular activities similar to those found in the U.S., including athletics, drama, music, and student government. The Ottawa school year, longer than that of the U.S., runs from Labor Day to the last week in June. Students have a week-long vacation at Christmas and a spring break of 10 days (usually in March). Grades are released quarterly.\nOttawa has a number of nursery schools which accept children from age three. In addition, there are a number of \"play schools\" for children 18 months to age four. These are usually two or three half days a week, and these require some type of parent participation.\nThere are two private preparatory schools in the Ottawa area: Elm-wood School for girls (kindergarten through the fourth grade is coeducational; grades five through 13 are only for girls), and Ashbury College for boys (covering grades five through 13). Ashbury enrolls both day and boarding students.\nTwo universities, a technical institute, a teachers' college, and a variety of business and professional schools provide ample opportunity for education on a full-or part-time basis. These include Carleton University (English-language and private, founded in 1942); and University of Ottawa (bilingual and government-supported, founded in 1848). These universities offer a multitude of courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels leading to degrees in liberal arts, sciences, engineering, theology, business administration, education, medicine, nursing, law, and applied sciences. Evening courses at both universities provide many opportunities for both degree and non-degree study. Both universities have extensive evening programs for part-time students as well. Unlike most U.S. colleges, courses are generally conducted on a yearly rather than semester basis.\nAlgonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology, a community college with four campuses, offers a wide range of day and evening courses, one-year certificate programs, and two-and three-year diploma programs. In general, tuition and fees for colleges and universities in Ottawa are less than those of state colleges and universities in the U.S.\nOttawa has four schools for trainable, mentally handicapped children. They are École Jeanne-Lajoie, the Clifford Bowie School, McHugh School (affiliated with the Royal Ottawa Psychiatric Center), and the Crystal Bay School (Carleton Board of Education). One school, Centennial, is for the physically handicapped, and additionally, the Ottawa Crippled Children's Treatment Center has teaching facilities for physically handicapped and autistic children.\nOther educational opportunities include tutoring or group study in languages, music, dance, art, and related activities. These are available for all ages at reasonable cost, usually through the various school systems, Algonquin College, the universities, and the YMCA. Often, however, waiting lists are encountered for those wishing to obtain the most competent instruction available. This is particularly true of French-language courses.\nRecreation\nExtensive opportunities for participation in many recreational sports activities exist in and around Ottawa. In winter, cross-country and downhill skiing are very popular. Trails and slopes abound within a 100-mile radius of the city, ranging from those for the beginner or casual skier to expert slopes for the advanced enthusiast.\nMain roads are kept open and passable in winter, providing access to a number of ski trails and tows in developed ski complexes. Bus service is available. There is one ski area within the Ottawa city limits—Carlington Park. Within an hour's drive are the ski complexes of Camp Fortune and Edelweiss Valley. Camp Fortune, located in Quebec Province (in Gatineau Park) is one of the country's largest ski complexes, offering downhill and cross-country skiing at all levels of difficulty, day and night skiing, instruction, and rentals. It is a 20-minute drive from Ottawa.\nFarther afield, the slopes at Mount St. Marie (Quebec) and Calabogie (Ontario) are 60 miles away. All have a variety of slopes and trails and offer instruction and rentals. Season passes for instruction, rentals, and tows are offered at most ski facilities. The elaborate winter sports resorts of Mount Tremblant, Quebec, can be reached from Ottawa in about three hours.\nOttawa also boasts what is billed as the world's largest outdoor skating rink. During the winter, a five-mile stretch of the Rideau Canal, built by the British after the War of 1812, between Dow's Lake and the National Arts Center is cleared and partially lighted for ice skating. Warming huts and snack bars are located at convenient intervals along the canal. It is not unusual to see business-people, with briefcases in tow, skate to work on the canal.\nAmple facilities for all types of sports have been developed in and around Ottawa, including ice skating arenas, curling rinks, bowling alleys, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and tennis and squash courts. One of the largest, and most unique, is the Nepean Sportsplex located in West Ottawa. Under one  roof it contains an ice skating rink, hockey arena, curling rink, gymnasium, squash courts, indoor swimming pool, auditorium, sauna, pub, and restaurant. It offers instruction for all age groups in sports activities as well as physical fitness classes, ski fitness clinics, arts and crafts, ballroom dancing, and ballet and tap dancing. The sportsplex publishes an annual bulletin of activities; enrollment in some courses is limited, and first preference is given to Nepean Township residents.\nIn the summer, ample opportunity for all types of water sports exists on the Ottawa, Rideau, and Gatineau Rivers, and at nearby lakes. There are several yacht clubs with extensive sailing programs. Beaches within Ottawa city limits are limited to one or two spots along the Rideau River, and Britannia Beach on the Ottawa River; facilities at these places are often crowded. On some of the lakes in the area, both in Ontario and Quebec, there are developed-access roads, beaches, and docks for canoes and boats, while other lakes are more isolated and primitive.\nSome private golf clubs keep their courses open from May to October; several operate their dining rooms all winter. Ottawa also has public courses.\nTennis and squash facilities are available at a number of private clubs, such as the Ottawa Athletic Club. Municipal tennis courts are scattered about the area as well, offering seasonal membership at reasonable cost, or free use on a space-available basis. Instruction is also provided at the private and public tennis facilities.\nBicycling and jogging are very popular during summer, and there are numerous cycling and jogging trails in Ottawa and across the Ottawa River in Quebec's Gatineau Park. Some roads are closed to auto traffic on Sundays for the exclusive use of hikers, joggers, and cyclists. Additional popular participant sports include archery, badminton, bowling, camping, cricket, flying, judo, riding, rugby, rowing, soccer, snowshoeing, and sailing.\nFor the spectator in winter, ice hockey, Canada's national sport, is virtually a mania. National Hockey League games are televised several times a week. In 1992 the Ottawa Senators, a new National Hockey League franchise, began play. The Ottawa Rough Riders represent Ottawa in the Canadian professional football league. The season begins in late July and ends in early December with the Grey Cup finals between the champions of the Eastern and Western Conferences.\nCanadians are avid baseball fans, too, and root for the American major league teams as well as the Canadian entries in Toronto (Blue Jays) and Montreal (Expos). Tickets for Montreal Expo games are sold in Ottawa, and there are chartered buses from downtown Ottawa to the baseball stadium in Montreal for selected games. Stock car racing is held in Stittsville, about 20 miles from Ottawa, in the summer months.\nIn the greater Ottawa area, which includes suburban areas in and around Hull, Quebec, there are numerous parks operated by various municipal, provincial, and federal authorities. Much of the land adjacent to the Ottawa River on the Ontario side is part of the National Capital Commission and is maintained as park land, with hiking and bicycle trails which serve as cross-country skiing trails in winter. In nearby Quebec is the largest of the area parks, Gatineau Park, whose 75,000 acres are maintained by the National Capital Commission. It offers opportunities to painters, hikers, photographers, naturalists, skiers, and picnickers.\nOttawa citizens often form private fishing and hunting clubs, which acquire and stock private lakes within driving distance. Public or crown lands, other than in the protected areas of Gatineau Park, are generally open to hunters and fishermen. Ontario hunting licenses are issued for a nominal fee upon presentation of a valid hunting license from another province or from the U.S., or after passing a basic firearms handling test.\nIn Ottawa there are several museums of interest, including the National Gallery of Art; the Museum of Science and Industry, with unique viewer-participation exhibits especially recommended for school-age children; the Museum of Man; the Bytown Museum (natural history); and Laurier House (former residence of Canadian prime ministers).\nTours of the Parliament buildings are conducted daily throughout the year. During the summer there are sight-seeing tours and moonlight cruises on the Rideau Canal and the Ottawa River. Tours of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police headquarters, the Queen's Printer, the Royal Canadian Mint, and other government agencies can be arranged upon request. Within an easy drive of Ottawa are the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Thousand Islands area, and the restored pioneer settlement of Upper Canada Village.\nToronto and Montreal, Canada's two largest urban centers, are both close to Ottawa—Toronto is 275 miles to the west, and Montreal 120 miles to the east. Toronto, five hours away by road and rail and 55 minutes by air, is the business center of Canada. Here, visitors find a wide variety of reasonable hotel accommodations, extensive shopping facilities, museums, restaurants, and a lively theater district. Montreal is only two hours from Ottawa by road and rail, or 35 minutes by air, and offers a definite French-Canadian atmosphere, which can be enjoyed in a day's visit or for a longer period. There are attractive shopping areas, numerous restaurants, nightclubs, museums, and theaters.\nWashington, DC (Dulles) and Baltimore, Maryland (BWI) airports are connected to Ottawa by direct air service. There are daily flights between Ottawa and BWI. Air travelers to other cities in the U.S. must  make connections in either Montreal or Toronto. Washington, DC is about 600 miles by road from Ottawa, via excellent interstate highways. New York City can be reached in one day by car and is about 455 miles from Ottawa, also via interstate highways.\nEntertainment\nOttawa offers a wide variety of entertainment. The National Arts Center is a cultural center of the first rank, where national and international stars, orchestras, and ballet and theatrical troupes perform regularly. Top-flight soloists and musical groups also are featured at Ottawa and Carleton Universities in programs which are open to the public. The Ottawa Little Theater, with a cast of amateur players, offers a full season of plays.\nOttawa now has some 20 movie houses, and an active National Film Theater whose thrice-weekly showings of classic and foreign films attract crowds of movie buffs to the auditorium in the Public Archives.\nThe National Gallery of Canada owns and displays a small but excellent collection of European and Canadian paintings, and a small group of contemporary American art. Special exhibits are scheduled throughout the year; the opening ceremonies and receptions are well-attended social events. The gallery also sponsors film shows and art lectures.\nThe number and quality of Ottawa's restaurants has been rising, and ethnic cuisine is available in a range of prices. Dancing is provided nightly in hotels, in the National Arts Center, and in several of the nightclubs in town and across the Ottawa River in Hull, Quebec. Another attraction in Hull is the abundance of excellent restaurants which may be found in that predominantly French-Canadian city.\nAnnual events of interest are the Winterlude Festival in February; the Tulip Festival in the latter half of May; and the Central Canada  Exhibition, a week-long country fair held each September.\nBecause of the absence of a language barrier and the openness of Canadian society, Americans blend easily into the local scene. Ottawa has a number of social clubs and public activities which provide opportunities for contact with Canadians. These include an International Women's Club; Boy and Girl Scout groups; and a number of civic organizations, such as Lions, Rotary, Kiwanis, and Optimists.\nToronto\nToronto, Canada's largest city, occupies the site of an old French trading post, Fort Rouillé founded in the 1790s. The city was founded as a British Army garrison town, Fort York, on the shores of Lake Ontario in 1793. It succeeded Niagara-on-the-Lake as capital of Upper Canada in 1797. Chartered as a city in 1834, its name was then changed to Toronto. Toronto served as the country's capital from 1849 to 1851, and from 1855 to 1859.\nThe Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto consists of the city of Toronto and five boroughs, with an estimated population of 4.7 million (2000), and covering an area of about 625 square miles. It is a beautiful city of parks and trees with a mixture of old and new buildings, connected by an excellent network of roads. Tall construction has been kept to a minimum, creating a feeling of spaciousness. The city is the capital of the Province of Ontario, the most populous and industrialized province in Canada. Toronto is the commercial, financial, and industrial center of Canada.\nWith the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, Toronto has become an important shipping center with modern harbor facilities. It is also one of Canada's principal aviation and railway focal points. Well over 1,000 U.S.-controlled companies have plants or representation within the U.S. consular district, and American investment in the area is enormous. This area is said to contain the largest concentration of American-owned or American-controlled plants in any consular district outside the U.S.\nToronto is the headquarters of the Canadian book and magazine publishing industry, three large daily newspapers, and English-language radio and TV broadcasting. It is the center of English-speaking culture in Canada.\nAn estimated 200,000 U.S. citizens live in the district; many are dual   nationals. In addition, tens of thousands of Americans visit the city annually, many of them in connection with conventions, or while en route to and from recreation and vacation areas north of the city.\nEducation\nEnglish is the language of instruction in virtually all public schools and in the universities. For those families who may be interested, French has been offered recently as the language of instruction at certain selected public schools throughout the metropolitan area. French is also taught as a required subject in elementary schools.\nToronto's public school system, used by most expatriates, consists of kindergarten, eight years of elementary school, and four or five years of secondary school, depending on the course selected. The fifth year of high school (grade 13), once necessary for admission to most universities in Ontario, is currently being phased out to put Ontario in step with the rest of Canada and the United States. Standards in Toronto secondary schools are comparable to those in the U.S. Course work may be on a yearly basis or semester system, depending on the school attended. Some students entering during the later high school years may have difficulty with subjects that are not taught as a matter of course in American schools. In Canadian schools, many subjects build on a foundation established the year or two before. It does not seem to be an impossible problem, but young people should come prepared to study hard if they wish to enter a collegiate school. It also should be remembered that, in this bilingual country, French is required of all students. All college entrance examinations are offered in Toronto.\nA separate school system is maintained for Roman Catholic children. Catholic schools receive financial support from the property taxes assessed on those homes occupied by Roman Catholic families. Education is free through grade 10, but tuition must be paid from grade 11. Uniforms are required beginning in ninth grade, and only a couple of Catholic schools are coeducational.\nSeveral excellent private schools accept both boarding and day pupils. Tuition rates are about the same as in comparable schools in the northeastern U.S. These schools are usually not coeducational, and uniforms are worn.\nToronto offers extensive educational opportunities, ranging from the University of Toronto to night courses available at the local high schools.\nThe University of Toronto (founded in 1827), an institution of high academic standing, offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in virtually all fields of endeavor, including the arts, sciences, commerce, medicine, applied sciences, and engineering. The Ontario College of Art and the Royal Conservatory of Music are affiliated with the university.\nYork University is Toronto's second university; founded in 1959, it is much newer, and has faculties of art, administrative studies, environmental studies, fine arts, science, and law.\nAdmission standards at both universities are high, and completion of grade 13 or an equivalent year is mandatory. Undergraduate courses  are offered in the evening, and summer school is also available.\nIn addition to university-level education, the past few years have seen a rise in the number of community colleges. These schools offer post-secondary education in numerous fields, primarily in technical areas.\nThe Toronto area offers exceptional facilities for the education of the mentally retarded. Special full-time programs are available through the public schools; counseling, special classes, and parent relief activities by the Provincial Ministry of Community and Social Services' Surrey Place Center; and a very active association for the retarded with its own nursery and training programs and community activities (summer camp, meetings with specialists, etc.). These combine to provide families with retarded children greater opportunities for development. However, as possibilities may depend on the age of the child and the nature of the retardation, advanced contact with the Metropolitan Toronto Association for the Mentally Retarded and with Surrey Place Center is advised.\nRecreation\nToronto and the nearby areas have much to offer the sports enthusiast, both as spectator and participant. For the spectator there are both professional and amateur hockey, football, soccer, lacrosse, tennis, wrestling, boxing, baseball, and horse racing.\nHockey is by far the most popular professional spectator sport, and is followed by all ages with such enthusiasm that it ranks as a national craze. The Toronto Maple Leafs, an entry in the National Hockey League, play to packed houses at Maple Leaf Gardens from October through April.\nClose behind hockey in popularity is football. The Toronto Argonauts are members of the Canadian Football League. There are two horse racing tracks within the metropolitan area offering both thoroughbred and harness racing. Pari-mutuel betting is permitted. The Toronto Blue Jays baseball team became a member of the American League in 1977, and has gained an enthusiastic following of fans of all ages; they won the Eastern Division pennant in 1985 and the World Series in 1992.\nFor the sports participant, there are swimming, tennis, roller and ice skating, curling, golf, bowling, skiing, fishing, and hunting. Swimming is a popular summer sport and there are many public pools, operated by the Toronto Parks Commission. Because these pools are usually overcrowded on weekends, and because the waters of Lake Ontario are generally considered too cold for anything other than wading, many Torontonians head north to the lake regions for swimming.\nTennis can be played on a number of public courts. Artificial ice skating rinks are located throughout the metropolitan area. Curling, a new game to most Americans, is another popular winter sport, played indoors on ice in arenas built expressly for this purpose.\nNumerous golf courses are in the Toronto area or within a 30-or 40-mile drive. They range from crowded public courses to the exclusive, well-maintained, and expensive private clubs.\nBecause of Toronto's proximity to Lake Ontario and the lake regions to the north, boating is a popular summer pastime, and the city has several yacht clubs. Good fishing and hunting can be found by driving about 120 to 150 miles north of the city. Skiing in and around Toronto is possible, but the real skiing enthusiast will go north 60 to 100 miles to the Collingwood and Gravenhurst areas.\nThe Province of Ontario maintains an excellent system of toll-free expressways and paved secondary roads, making all but the most remote parts of the province accessible by car. However, traffic is heavy, particularly during the summer months. Distance by road (miles) to the following points are: Buffalo, New York, 100; Windsor-Detroit, 235; Ottawa, 286; Montreal, 350; Quebec City, 480; New York City, 478; and Washington, DC, 520.\nToronto's fine park system offers a variety of activities, winter and summer. The pride of the system is Centre Island Park, located on a large island in Lake Ontario off the harbor area, and accessible only by ferry. Ontario Place is also located on a series of man-made islands in Lake Ontario, adjacent to the Canadian National Exhibition grounds, the largest annual exhibition in the world. The Canadian National Exhibition is a popular event. The exhibition features theatrical and musical events, animals, farm and horticultural displays, and an international air show.\nChildren's playgrounds are located throughout the city and, in summer, playground directors supervise children's activities. During winter, the Parks Department operates numerous ice skating and hockey rinks.\nEntertainment\nToronto does not lack cultural or entertainment activities, and offers everything normally found in a cosmopolitan city of comparable size.\nMany first-run and neighborhood movie theaters show American, British, and foreign films. Live theater is also very much in evidence in the Toronto area. The 3,200-seat O'Keefe Centre for the Performing Arts and the Royal Alexandra Theatre both present full seasons of opera, ballet, and musical and dramatic productions, featuring not only the top Canadian companies, but also the best American and British companies. Toronto's concert hall, Massey Hall, a venerable old building with near-perfect acoustics, housed the Toronto Symphony Orchestra until the Roy Thomson Hall was opened. Recitals are given here by touring internationally known artists.\nIn Stratford, Ontario, about 90 miles southwest of Toronto, the Stratford Shakespearean Festival  features world famous actors. Niagara-on-the-Lake, about 80 miles south of Toronto, is the home of the Shaw Festival. Both have become very popular spots for the theater lover during the summer season.\nJazz, folk music, chamber music, and numerous smaller professional and amateur theatrical groups can be found throughout Toronto. The city is purported to be the third most important center for theater in the world, after New York and London. There are also many fine restaurants of every cuisine, cocktail lounges, coffee shops, and nightclubs to suit every taste.\nThe Royal Ontario Museum, the Ontario Art Gallery, the McLaughlin Planetarium, and the Ontario Science Centre provide many hours of interesting viewing.\nMontreal\nMontreal, with an estimated metropolitan population of 3.4 million, is the second largest city in Canada and the second-largest French speaking city in the world. When Jacques Cartier visited the area that is presently Montreal in 1535, he found the Indian village of Hochelaga. The island was visited in 1603 by Samuel de Champlain, but was not settled by the French until 1642, when Sieur de Maisonneuve founded the Ville Marie de Montreal. The city became the center of fur trade and a starting point of expeditions into the interior. Montreal was the last Canadian city held by the French; it surrendered to the British in 1760. From 1844 to 1849, Montreal was the seat of Canadian government.\nMontreal is a cosmopolitan city of charm and variety, where skyscrapers share space with 200-year-old buildings. More than two-thirds of its people are French-speaking. Most of the rest are English-speaking, primarily of English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh descent. Italians are the third largest ethnic group. About 60% of all the people in Montreal speak English fluently. Several million Americans visit the  Province of Quebec every year, and nearly all visit Montreal.\nThe visitor soon discovers that Montreal has everything needed for a pleasant stay—an absorbing history, a rich and varied culture, outstanding cultural and recreational facilities, comfortable and attractive apartments and houses, a French cuisine which justifies the title of \"Paris of America,\" and over 3,000 restaurants specializing in the foods of many other nationalities. The general standard of living is high. Montrealers, particularly well-to-do French-Canadians, are more fashion-conscious than most Americans and accept European style trends more readily.\nMontreal is located in the southern part of the Province of Quebec, 120 miles east of Ottawa, and about 40 miles from the New York and Vermont borders. By car, it is 400 miles from New York City and 615 miles from Washington, DC. It is situated on an island some 30 miles long, and seven to 10 miles wide, at the junction of the St. Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers. Mount Royal, for which it is named, rises almost in the center of the city to a height of about 765 feet above sea level (the city's average altitude is 63 feet). Most of Mount Royal is a natural park, providing areas for picnics in summer and skating and skiing in winter.\nEducation\nOver the last several years, the school system in Quebec has been in a state of some turmoil because of strikes and linguistic and pedagogical issues. The current provincial language law severely restricts access to English education, although exceptions are granted to children expecting to live in Quebec Province for temporary periods only.\nThe public school system in Montreal consists of 11 grades (grades one through six is elementary school; grades seven through 11 is high school).  Some public schools have kindergartens, but this is not the general rule. The public schools, which are free, are run by two separate school boards: Catholic and Protestant, each administering francophone and anglophone schools. For public school purposes, Protestant generally means non-Catholic. Basic instruction can be in French or English. Moreover, English schools provide French immersion courses in which students may elect to take a portion of their subjects in French.\nStudents entering the Quebec system in the elementary grades will generally find the education to be on a par with that in the U.S., with the bonus of being able to develop a sound knowledge of French. Students entering at the secondary level may, however, encounter problems as a result of French-language requirements and the 11-grade system.\nProvincial regulations require that any student who has been in Quebec for more than two years pass a French equivalency test, given to all 11th-grade students, in order to receive a school leaving certificate, which is the equivalent of a high school diploma. Most students entering in the eighth or ninth grades will therefore require extra tutoring to enable them to attain required proficiency levels in French.\nGrading procedures in Quebec are also different than in the U.S. For the upper grades, class marks, which are reflected in transcripts, are heavily based on standardized provincial examinations, given at the end of the year to all Quebec students.\nThe absence of a 12th grade presents other problems. For the Quebec student, the normal sequence is to graduate from high school at the end of the 11th year, enter the two-year CEGEP system (somewhat like a U.S. junior college), and subsequently go on to a university. Based on recent experience, education authorities will not authorize entry to the CEGEP system for any American student who has not graduated from an American high school. The alternatives for an entering student who would normally enter the 12th grade in the U.S. are to repeat the 11th grade, which Quebec authorities insist is equivalent to the American 12th grade, or to go to school in the U.S.\nAmerican students finishing the 11th grade in Quebec have several alternatives. They may elect to go to a boarding school in the U.S. for the 12th grade, although a graduating student could elect to stay in Montreal, since one private boy's school offers a 12th-grade program. However, no 12th-grade programs for girls exist in Montreal. Alternatively, the student could elect to enter the CEGEP system or apply directly to an American college. Some Quebec students enter U.S. colleges after the 11th grade. The willingness of an American college to consider the application of an American student from Quebec would depend, however, on the success of the student in fulfilling course requirements by the end of the 11th grade.\nMontreal has a number of private schools. Entrance to these schools is based on competitive examinations, and most of them have waiting lists for entry. The role of private schools in Quebec and the extent to which they should receive government support are under review by the provincial government. Most private schools in Quebec require uniforms.\nMontreal has adequate facilities for any type of education from nursery school to the most advanced academic and scientific degrees; private tutoring in any subject; instruction in music, dancing, painting, and the other arts; and special training in crafts, hobbies, sports, gardening, use of power equipment, and other skills.\nThe Montreal school system has facilities at all grade levels for both physical (including the deaf and blind) and learning handicaps.\nThe school year runs from just after Labor Day until mid-June. The opening and closing dates for Catholic and Protestant schools differ by a few days, but time in school is the same. All schools have a five-day week. Schools have a two-week holiday at Christmas and a few days at Easter, usually Holy Thursday through Easter Monday.\nWhile extracurricular activities are similar to those in the U.S., they tend to be less extensive, particularly in the area of sports.\nMontreal's universities have many American students. The largest of the universities is the French-language Université de Montreal, founded in 1876. The Université du Quebec à Montreal (founded in 1969) is also a French-language institution. Most popular with Americans is the English-language McGill University, founded in 1821. The other large English-language institution is Concordia University, formed by the amalgamation of Sir George Williams University and Loyola College. Concordia has an extensive evening program where it is possible to earn degrees in a variety of fields. All of Montreal's universities offer evening extension programs, but not all lead to degrees.\nRecreation\nCanada's national sport is hockey. Canadian children learn to skate almost as soon as they learn to walk, and start playing hockey soon thereafter. In winter, free public skating and hockey rinks are found in every section of the city. During the season, Les Canadiens, Montreal's almost legendary National Hockey League team, play at the Forum. Announcements at Canadiens games are made in both French and English.\nMontreal's professional baseball team, the Expos, is part of the National Baseball League. The Expos utilize the 1976 Olympic Stadium for their home games. Bowling and curling also are popular, and there are a number of clubs and leagues.\nThe city has many public tennis courts, and a number of tennis clubs, some with indoor courts. The Montreal area is dotted with private golf courses. A few public courses exist, but they are usually crowded. Excellent and extensive jogging paths are located on Mount Royal. Joggers also enjoy running along the seven-mile Lachine Canal. The Montreal International Marathon, run in late September, attracts over 10,000 participants annually.\nBoating is popular. Several yacht clubs on Lake St. Louis (about a half-hour by car from the city) and on the Lake of Two Mountains offer keen inter-club competition and a limited cruising area. Most sailboats on Lake St. Louis are center-board types because of the large shoal areas, but there are many larger boats, and the International Dragon Class is very active. Two-to three-week cruises to the Thousand Islands, Ottawa, and the Rideau or Lake Champlain are popular with local yachters.\nMontreal has an excellent range of readily accessible year-round recreational opportunities in Quebec Province and in northern New York and New England. The Laurentian mountain area, which begins about 45 miles from the city and includes Mont Tremblant Park, is one of the most attractive winter and summer resort areas in Canada. Mont Tremblant, 100 miles from Montreal, and Stowe, Vermont, 120 miles away, provide the best skiing in eastern North America. There is limited skiing in Montreal itself on Mount Royal, but the nearest really good skiing areas begin about 50 miles away. Cross-country skiing is very popular both in and outside of Montreal.\nThe many lakes in the Laurentians and other nearby areas provide swimming, boating, and water-skiing. There are good camping facilities and accommodations, from luxury hotels to simple lodgings in all areas.\nFishing and hunting are good and are possible close to Montreal. The lakes, rivers, and streams of the province have a variety of fish; speckled trout are the most common. Partridge are found in most woods. The flyways over Lake St. Francis and Lake St. Peter, each about 75 miles from Montreal, offer some of the finest duck shooting in North America. About 150 miles down the St. Lawrence is the only place in the world for hunting the beautiful snow goose. Deer and bear are found within 100 miles of the city.\nMontreal has 362 parks. The top of Mount Royal has been preserved as a 500-acre natural forest park. Both the Chalet, at the peak, and Beaver Lake, at the beginning of the park area, are popular in winter and summer. The Chalet has a remarkable view of the city. Beaver Lake, an artificial lagoon, is a favorite place for model-boat enthusiasts. In addition to skiing and tobogganing in winter, the Beaver Lake Pavilion has a large ice skating rink. Mount Royal also has bridle paths for horseback riders.\nAnother delightful park is located on St. Helen's and Notre Dame Islands in the middle of the St. Lawrence, between the harbor and the seaway. It has an amusement park (the site of Expo '67), swimming pools, picnic areas and playgrounds, and other attractions, including Montreal's Military and Maritime Museum. Its Helene-de-Champlain Restaurant, in a castle-like chalet, provides a picturesque setting and good food.\nThe Garden of Wonders, better known as the Children's Zoo, is a fascinating feature of Lafontaine Park, which also has two lagoons. Rowboats are for rent, and rides can be taken in a miniature paddle-wheeler \"showboat\" and in a miniature train.\nThe extensive greenhouses of Montreal's Botanical Gardens, conveniently located on a principal street, are open all year; its outdoor gardens are open from May or June to October. There are spectacular exhibitions in November and at Easter, and excellent shows at various other times.\nMontreal has a number of fine museums. The best historical museum is the Chateau de Ramezay, built in 1705 as the residence for the governor of Montreal. It was the headquarters of the American Army of Occupation in 1775-76, and well-known Americans who stayed there included Benjamin Franklin, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, and Benedict Arnold. Redpath Museum has interesting geological and zoological exhibits and Indian relics. McGill University's McCord Museum, now associated with the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, has a unique collection of Canadian historical and North American archaeological exhibits. The Wax Museum has more than 200 life-size figures, depicting scenes from Canada's earliest history to modern times. The Bell Telephone Company of Canada has an industrial science museum with original equipment, replicas, and pictures of communications from ancient sight and sound signals to Telstar. Many of these exhibits can be seen in operation.\nThe Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, entering its second century, is located in the city's center, and houses a formidable collection of paintings, decorative arts, and sculptures, as well as ancient glass and textile collections.\nSeveral Catholic churches have museums with collections of paintings and religious and other exhibits. The museum of Notre Dame de Bon Secours Church, also known as the Sailor's Church, has model ships presented by sailors and an excellent collection of fine dolls. There is also the Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened prior to the 1976 World's Fair held in Montreal. A planetarium and an aquarium were established within the city during 1966-67.\nIn February 1990, the Montreal Insectarium opened to the public. Built to resemble a stylized insect, the building has a total area of   approximately 7,000 square feet and includes exhibition areas, open-space laboratories, a multipurpose hall and a 40-seat theater.\nEntertainment\nNowhere is Montreal's cosmopolitan nature better reflected than in its entertainment. Plays may be seen throughout the year in both English and French, with occasional productions in other languages. A mobile summer theater for children is operated by the Montreal Parks Department. The Montreal ballet company, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, performs regularly, and there are other ballet performances as well.\nMontreal's modern Place des Artes is the city's center for symphonies, ballets, stage productions, and visiting national and international performers. Place des Arts houses three theaters, the largest seating approximately 3,000 people. Throughout the year, there are many vocal and instrumental recitals. The International Music Competition, held in May or June of each year, is one of the most important artistic events held in Montreal. The Montreal International Jazz Festival, held in June or July, features concerts and shows by many of the world's great jazz musicians. The World Film Festival is held annually in August and September.\nThere are many movie houses, both downtown and in the neighborhoods. New American films are shown at the same time as in the U.S. Films are in English and French. A few theaters show films in their original languages, with English or French subtitles.\nThe midwinter Carnival festivities in Quebec City are attended by many people from Montreal, Quebec, New England, New York, and elsewhere. The Sherbrooke Festival des Cantons features Quebecois shows, horse-pulling, and gourmet cuisine.\nAlmost every social group contains a number of the Americans living in Montreal. An American Women's Club meets regularly for lunch and has annual bazaars, fashion shows, dances, and bridge tournaments for the benefit of Canadian charities. The Montreal Post of the American Legion is also active. No other American community organizations exist.\nQuebec City\nQuebec City is the provincial capital and the center of French Canada. The city takes its name from an Algonquin Indian word meaning where the river narrows, but its many residents, although North American, bear the clear imprint of their French ancestry and culture. The city is located on the site of the old Indian town of Stadacona and was visited by Jacques Cartier in 1535 and 1541. In 1608, Samuel de Champlain established a trading  post here which became the first permanent settlement. The area was briefly controlled by the British and was the capital of New France from 1663 to 1763. It also served as capital of Canada from 1851 to 1855, and from 1859 to 1867.\nGreater Quebec is a metropolitan area of about 646,000. Quebec, the largest municipality, is divided into two distinct areas. These are Lower Town (which winds around the base of the promontory, along the banks of the St. Lawrence into the St. Charles River Valley), and Upper Town (on heights 200 to 300 feet above the St. Lawrence). When viewed from the sister city of Levis (part of Greater Quebec), Upper Town has a distinctly Old World appearance, including the imposing roof and turrets of the Château Frontenac. Stone walls encircle part of the business and residential section of Upper Town and reach to the ramparts of the Citadelle. The area within the old city walls is recognized as a historic monument. Building restrictions and the tasteful restoration of old houses preserve the Old World flavor of the area. Most buildings in the city have painted tin roofs, dormer windows, colorful shutters, and wooden doors.\nThe city's population is about 96% French-speaking. Most of the remainder are English Canadians, and only a small minority is of other national and racial origins. In the surrounding countryside, the population is almost totally French-speaking, and is descended from French colonists led by Champlain, who established the first settlement in 1608. Although they are undeniably French in origin, their attitudes and viewpoints reflect the fact that development of their distinctive society has taken place in North America.\nQuebec harbor is one of the most important in Canada. It has extensive passenger and freight-handling facilities, including large elevators for the transshipment of grain. Quebec is a regularly scheduled port of call for steamship lines during the ice-free months from April through November and, for several years, has enjoyed an increasing volume of winter freight traffic as well.\nThe Port City life has been reanimated at the Vieux-Port de Quebec. La Societé du Vieux-Port, commissioned by the Canadian Government, manages this facility which consists of a walkway, outdoor amphitheater, marina, market, and residential units.\nIn 1977, developers and artists pooled their resources to rescue North America's oldest neighborhood from an undeserved fate. Warmed with color and flowers, the Quartier Petit Champlain is once again a community and a real delight. Its beautifully restored houses shelter more than 50 businesses, outdoor cafes and restaurants ranging from classic French to European fast-food, art galleries, a theater, and charming boutiques. One can meet artists and crafts-people in their studios, or in the street, where pedestrians, musicians, clowns, and jugglers mingle.\nCurrently 2,000 Americans are registered with the U.S. Consulate and about 7,700 Americans live within the district, many of them French-Canadian descent.\nEducation\nQuebec's public and private schools, from preschool through eighth grade, are generally comparable to American schools. High schools, however, are organized somewhat differently and, in general, are less demanding than their American counterparts.\nThe final year of high school is the 11th year of studies. Provincial regulations require that every student have two years of high school French and pass both oral and written examinations in French before graduation. The exception to that rule is only for dependents of diplomats, who are exempt from the language law, and who may attend either English-or French-language schools.\nPublic schools in the province are Catholic or Protestant, but the emphasis on religion has diminished considerably in recent years. Quebec now generally minimizes the importance of religious study much the same as in U.S. public schools.\nQuebec has no French-language Protestant schools, public or private. Protestant parents are free to enroll their children in the French-language Catholic schools located throughout the city.\nExcellent boarding schools are found throughout the neighboring New England states and in Montreal.\nThere are a number of specialized schools and organizations in the area for physically and mentally handicapped individuals. Children with learning disabilities attend special classes in the regular school system. For those more severely handicapped, special education, including vocational training, is available through grade nine. Interested individuals should contact the U.S. Consulate in Quebec for further information.\nAt Laval University (founded in 1852), many faculties, such as medicine and law, accept students only at the graduate level. Other faculties accept students at what would be considered the undergraduate level. Students wishing to enter Laval should discuss the matter with university authorities.\nLaval offers evening courses during the academic year in a variety of subjects at the undergraduate level. Instruction in these courses is in French. Laval also offers an intensive summer French-language program which is well known in the U.S. and is attended by several thousand Americans each year. At other times, French-language instruction is offered in the evening at both beginning and advanced levels.\nRecreation\nMany opportunities exist for ice skating, skiing, and other winter sports in Quebec City. Good ski slopes are within 30 miles of town. Mount Ste. Anne—the highest—has a vertical drop of over 2,000 feet and is one of the best ski mountains in eastern North America. Cross-country skiing is enjoying a major boom, and cross-country trails are maintained in a great number of federal and provincial parks within easy driving distance. For those who prefer to break trail on their own, the open rolling countryside near the city offers virtually unlimited opportunities.\nIn winter, two or three professional ice hockey games are played each week by the National Hockey League's Quebec Nordiques. The Coliseum was recently renovated and enlarged. Announcements at Nordiques games are made only in French. Several other ice arenas in the municipal area provide instruction and organized competition in both hockey and figure skating.\nQuebec City's premier cold-weather event is the annual 10-day Winter Carnival, held in February. There are ice sculpture contests, a majestic ice castle on Place du Palais, a canoe race on the St. Lawrence, and two parades through city streets.\nSeveral indoor curling clubs admit both men and women to membership. There is great interest in this ancient sport here, and membership in one of these clubs affords an opportunity to meet a large number of business and professional persons.\nThere is good hunting and fishing close to Quebec. The provincial government runs camps in the Laurentides Park. Summertime can be very pleasant in Quebec, in spite of the overwhelming number of tourists who crowd into the city. Golf, tennis, sailing, and fishing are available near town, as well as swimming, hiking, and camping.\nQuebec City is the gateway to the Laurentides Park, which begins about 30 miles north of the city and is easily accessible on one of the newest and most modern highways in the province. The areas north and east of Quebec City abound in wooded hills and mountains, with numerous small lakes perfect for flat-water canoeing and boating. These areas can be reached in a short time on good roads. Fishing and hunting are excellent. There are opportunities for day-hiking and backpacking in the park, particularly in the valley of the Jacques Cartier River. The valley also affords supervised rock-climbing, as well as white-water canoeing and kayaking.\nA popular summer resort is located at Murray Bay (La Malbaie), on the north shore 100 miles down-river from Quebec. The principal hotel is the Manor Richelieu, operated by the Quebec Government. There is a fine swimming pool and golf course, both of which are open to the public. Another resort, Tadoussac, is 50 miles farther down-river at the mouth of the Saguenay River, but this resort is primarily popular with older people, and there is little excitement or activity to be found. Murray Bay can be reached by train, car, or the Saguenay excursion boats in half a day. Tadoussac can be reached by car, although the road is not well surfaced. The trip is best made by boat.\nBaie St. Paul, on the north shore 89 miles down-river from Quebec, has an art center and several art galleries. This artists' haven is also a favorite among crafts-people.\nChicoutimi, a city of 60,000, located 130 miles north of Quebec City, is a tourist base for exploring the Saguenay area. The Saguenay River itself is a fjord with steep canyon walls which can be viewed from sight-seeing boats from June to September. The city is also surrounded by true \"wilderness,\" offering excellent hunting and fishing as well as numerous other outdoor activities.\nThe south shore of the St. Lawrence and the Gaspé Peninsula has many small resorts of interest during the warmer months, and the trip around this spectacular peninsula can be made comfortably in four or five days by car. Lake St. Joseph and Lake Beauport, about 30 to 15 miles, respectively, from Quebec, are pleasant places to spend a day or weekend during summer.\nAn attraction only five miles from Quebec is the thunderous Mont-morency Falls; just beyond that lies the Island of Orleans, accessible by bridge, which retains much of the charm of the early French-Canadian countryside. The island has several good restaurants and numerous artisan stores offering handwoven articles and ceramics. In summer, visitors can buy fresh fruit at farmers' stands, or pick their own in the fields.\nA short distance farther along the north shore of the river is Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Refuge, where virtually the entire east coast population of snow geese congregate in a vast honking horde twice a year, in the spring and fall, on their way to breeding or wintering grounds.\nEntertainment\nQuebec has several good movie theaters showing American, French, French Canadian and, occasionally, English films. One or two theaters show English-language pictures, but most American films are shown with French soundtracks.\nMany visiting companies and artists stop in Quebec. The Quebec Symphony Orchestra, the oldest in Canada, has a full season. There are several avant-garde stock theater groups of considerable talent. An opera company performs occasionally during the winter season, and gifted local folk singers offer concerts. The Grand Théâtre, dedicated in January 1971, has a large auditorium for music, plays, and opera, and a small auditorium for experimental theater. The Grand Théâtre is the home of the Quebec Symphony Orchestra. Several societies, such as the Institut Canadien, offer interesting series of lectures and concerts.\nThe Quebec Winter Carnival is a major event in the area. For three weeks before the beginning of Lent, little else occupies the minds and time of the Quebecois. Among the principal events are the masquerade and regency balls, peewee hockey played by boys 12 and under, boat races over and around the ice floes on the St. Lawrence River, dogsled races, huge parades, and street dancing. A three-story palace is constructed of enormous blocks of ice, and ice snow statues are carved and placed along many city streets.\nDuring July, the city sponsors a 10-day music festival offering jazz, folk, rock, and classical music in several public parks in the old town. The city, in general, is particularly lively during summer as numerous Quebecois stroll through the historic area and frequent outdoor cafes.\nThe historic area of Quebec City is beautifully preserved and is completely surrounded by ramparts. The city's oldest hotel, the Chateau Frontenac, and the Citadel, a star-shaped military fortress, are two main historical attractions.\nQuebec boasts some excellent restaurants offering French cuisine, among them the Continental, Marie Clarisse, Rabelais, and the Serge Broyere; and out of town, the Manoir St. Castin at Lac Beauport. The variety of nightclubs is limited.\nThe recently-opened Museum of Civilization is a popular attraction in Quebec City. This museum contains an entire hall dedicated to the history of games—board games, cards, gambling, toys, and other recreational activities.\nThere are few resident Americans in Quebec, and they are well integrated into the community. A group called the American Colony Club meets infrequently, but participates in community activities and organizes an annual Thanksgiving dinner, a children's Christmas party, a summer picnic, and receptions. Rotary Club also has a chapter in the city.\nThe city's tourism office, located at 60 rue d'Auteuil, has advice and free booklets for tourists.\nVancouver\nVancouver, the third largest city after Toronto and Montreal, is the largest, most cosmopolitan, and most exciting city in western Canada. Strategically located in the extreme southwest corner of mainland British Columbia, it is the gateway to Alaska, to the Pacific Ocean, to the American Northwest, and to the Orient. The provincial capital and seat of government is Victoria, on Vancouver Island.\nThe first settlement in the area was established by 1865 and called Granville. It was incorporated as a city in 1881 and named for Captain George Vancouver. Vancouver's development was aided by the completion of the trans-Canada railroad in 1887. Fire destroyed Vancouver in 1886, the year it was incorporated. Reconstruction began immediately and an area known as Gastown became the new city center. The Gastown area declined when the commercial district expanded away from the waterfront; in 1969 restoration of Gastown began and it was preserved as a vital link to the city's past.\nAs of 2000, Vancouver had an estimated population near 2 million. It is by far the largest city in the Province of British Columbia. Vancouver is located on the eastern shore of the Strait of Georgia, between the Fraser River on the south and Burrard Inlet on the north. The city has a beautiful, landlocked, ice-free harbor, with wooded mountains to the north rising to 4,000 feet and snow-capped much of the year. Its glittering skyscrapers are softened by a dazzling array of parks that bring British Columbia's great outdoors to the heart of the urban setting. At its doorstep are 10 beaches and miles of sheltered cruising waters, with the lighted ski runs on Grouse Mountain only a half-hour to the north.\nVancouver's year-round port handles more dry tonnage than all five U.S. West Coast ports combined. The port is a hub for most passenger ships and Alaskan cruises from May to October.\nThe climate is comparable to that of Seattle, with few extremes of heat or cold. The temperature rarely exceeds 80°F in summer, and winters have relatively few days when the temperature drops below the freezing point. The mean temperature is 63°F in summer and 36°F in winter. Rainfall averages 59 inches  annually in Vancouver, but is considerably less in the outlying districts south of the city. There is also very little snowfall. Living conditions are comparable to those of many other large modern cities in North America, with the additional attraction of extensive and readily accessible outdoor recreational facilities.\nThe U.S. consular district covers both the Province of British Columbia and the Yukon Territory—a total of 573,331 square miles. It is an area greater than California, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, and Montana combined. The population is relatively small in British Columbia (3,105,000 in 1989) and in the Yukon (29,000 in 1990), but British Columbia is Canada's second fastest growing province.\nPeople from the prairie provinces, as well as immigrants to Canada, are moving into British Columbia in large numbers, attracted by the climate and economic opportunities. These include Australians, Indians, Iranians, Germans, Dutch, Italians, Scandinavians, French, Swiss, Filipinos, Chinese, and Japanese. Next to San Francisco and New York City, Vancouver has the third largest Chinatown in North America. As a result, many shops specializing in ethnic goods or foods are found in the city, in addition to a host of Chinese restaurants. Chinese laborers were instrumental in building the Canadian-Pacific Railway in this part of Canada.\nCurrently, about 60,500 American citizens reside in British Columbia and the Yukon. Tourism plays a major role in the economics of the province. About two million Americans visit \"The Evergreen Playground\" each year. Vancouver was the site of the world's fair—Expo '86—in 1986. It was opened on May 2 by the Prince and Princess of Wales, Charles and Diana.\nEducation\nPublic and private schools are on a par with those in the U.S. The Vancouver public school system consists of roughly 95 elementary schools and 18 secondary schools. Roman Catholic schools are run by the church and charge monthly tuition. One public elementary school offers a French immersion program through sixth grade. French is also offered as an optional subject, along with other foreign languages at the secondary level.\nVancouver has three provincial universities: the University of British Columbia (founded in 1890 at Point Gray), University of Victoria (founded in 1902, elevated to university status in 1963), and Simon Fraser University (founded in 1963 at Burnaby).\nIn addition to credit and non-credit programs and courses offered by technical institutes, vocational training centers, and community colleges, Vancouver and the surrounding municipalities offer adult education day and evening classes. Subjects range from strictly academic courses to instruction in sewing, golf, and ceramics. Fees are moderate.\nVancouver has about 30 educational facilities for the mentally retarded and physically handicapped. Treatment is available for most age groups in schools specializing in disabilities ranging from autistic and behavior disorders to the multi-handicapped. Schools specifically for the deaf and blind are also available. A complete listing of facilities may be obtained by writing directly to the U.S. Consulate General.\nRecreation\nVancouver is a sportsman's paradise. There are a number of excellent golf courses, both public and private, where the visitor can play most of the year. The city also has many public tennis courts. Horseback riding is available, but expensive. The surrounding mountains offer skiing from December through April. Popular runs are found on Seymour and Grouse Mountains in North Vancouver; Garibaldi Park, 30 miles from Vancouver; Whistler Mountain, some 75 miles away; and Mount Baker, east of Bellingham, Washington, where skiing is possible most of the year. Also available are numerous cross-country trails, some close by on the North Shore. There are several public and private ice skating rinks.\nBoating and water-skiing are very popular, and numerous small-boat launching sites and mooring facilities are found in the surrounding salt water. Many of the interior lakes also provide boating facilities. The boating season runs from late May through September. Bowling (both indoor and lawn variety) and curling are popular. The many mountain trails offer good hiking possibilities.\nFor the spectator-sports fan, Vancouver has three professional teams. The British Columbia Lions play in the Western Conference of the Canadian Football League; the Vancouver Canucks are in the National Hockey League; and the Vancouver Canadians, the top farm club of the Milwaukee Brewers, are members of the Pacific Coast League. Major U.S. sporting events are telecast in Vancouver as well.\nBritish Columbia is famous for its fishing and hunting. Freshwater trout and salmon are the most popular catches of the sport fisherman. For big game, including bear, deer, moose, mountain goat, and wild fowl, the hunter usually has to travel some distance into the interior of the province.\nCamping is a popular summer activity, but facilities are often rough in the interior regions.\nNumerous points of scenic interest are within easy driving distance of Vancouver. Vancouver Island, the largest island on the west coast of North and South America, features the provincial capital of Victoria, unusual gardens, beaches, and mountain scenery. One of the most scenic attractions in the Province of British Columbia, Victoria is just an hour's drive along the highway overlooking Howe Sound. The spectacular Fraser River Canyon is several hours away via Hope and Cache Creek.\nIn the interior of the province, east of Quesnel, lies the historic ghost town of Barkerville, a booming gold town a century ago. The Rocky Mountain Resorts of Banff and Lake Louise, about 650 miles east, just across the British Columbia-Alberta border, can be reached by car, rail, or plane almost all year. Alaska can also be reached via weekly sailings from Vancouver.\nMetropolitan Vancouver contains many attractive parks, the largest being world-famous Stanley Park on a 1,000-acre forested peninsula adjacent to the downtown area. Governor General Lord Stanley, in whose honor the NHL's championship cup was named, dedicated the peninsula as a park in 1889, a year after its official opening. Stanley's life-size statue graces the park's entrance. It is a prime tourist attraction, with a zoo, gardens, one of North America's finest aquariums, picnic areas, woodland trails, playgrounds, and scenic viewpoints overlooking the entrance to Vancouver harbor. The MacMillan-Bloedel Conservatory is in the park. Queen Elizabeth Park, south of the downtown section, is another picturesque area, noted for its flowers and views of the city and surrounding area.\nVancouver has a strong international flavor, with large Italian, Greek, and East Indian communities. The city has the second largest Chinatown in North America. Every possible kind of ethnic cuisine is served somewhere in the city.\nGastown is Vancouver's \"heritage\" area—a colorful redevelopment of the original settlement. Cobbled streets, a steam clock restored heritage buildings housing shops and restaurants, a town square and a statue of Vancouver pioneer Gassy Jack are all part of the ambience. Handicrafts and local artists flourish here.\nShopping in Vancouver tends to be mall oriented and, because it is a port city, many exotic goods can be found. The corner of Georgia and Grandville is the key to a major downtown shopping area. The city has two underground malls, Pacific Centre and Vancouver Centre. A $100-million extension to the Pacific Centre complex has made it one of the largest retail-office complexes in Canada. It is linked to the rest of the shopping center by overhead walkway and a tunnel. The extension added 100 stores to the existing 127 retail outlets, and features a covered central atrium and a waterfall.\nNumerous beaches exist in Vancouver proper and in north and west Vancouver, although the water is usually chilly, even in summer.\nVancouver also has a small but growing art gallery, an excellent maritime museum, and a new planetarium. The Anthropological Museum at the University of British Columbia is excellent.\nEntertainment\nEntertainment to suit all tastes is available at some time during the year. The excellent Vancouver Symphony Orchestra has a regular concert season extending from fall to spring. This and other orchestras, an opera company, soloists, and first-class theatrical companies, ballets, and choruses from many parts of the world perform at the modern Queen Elizabeth Theater, which has a capacity of 2,800.\nVancouver has a large pool of professional actors from which resident theater companies draw for stage productions of a high order. The Playhouse Theater Company, based in the Queen Elizabeth Theater, and the 450-seat Arts Club Theater, located on Granville Island, each offers seven or more major annual productions, ranging from Shakespeare to Tennessee Williams and modern Canadian playwrights.\nThe Waterfront Theater, Carousel Theater (for young people), and City Stage add to the variety of what is available on almost a year-round basis. A six-week Festival of Arts each summer features both local and visiting artists of distinction. A Jeunesses Musicales chapter fosters youthful musical activities in Vancouver and throughout the province. The city has many first-run movie theaters and assorted nightclubs.\nMany cultural events also take place from October to June at the University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University.\nThe Pacific National Exhibition (PNE), held the last two weeks of August, draws exhibitors from across Canada, the U.S., and other countries. Many top entertainers perform here during the exhibition's run. The \"midway\" section of the PNE also is open during summer and on weekends during good weather. An Oktoberfest is also held in Vancouver.\nThe excellent main public library has branches in every neighborhood.\nVancouver social life is like that in any large U.S. city. Americans soon find opportunities to make acquaintances among Canadians. People in Vancouver are hospitable and extend numerous invitations to various social or public affairs.\nOrganized groups include, among many others, the Board of Trade, Rotary, the English-Speaking Union, and the Consular Corps—both a men's and women's group. Vancouver has three downtown men's luncheon clubs; the Vancouver Club, the Terminal City Club, and the University Club. All of these offer comfortable, convenient facilities, pleasant associations, and good food. American men and women are welcome to participate in the charitable organizations that exist in Vancouver.\nCalgary\nCalgary is located in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, 3,440 feet above sea level. From the city, one can see jagged peaks of the Rockies rising to a height of 12,000 feet only 65 miles to the west. Calgary is 160 miles north of the U.S. border.\nCalgary, with an estimated population of 888,000 (2000), is one of Canada's  fastest growing cities. It is the center of Canada's oil industry (there are about 400 oil companies producing 90% of Canada's oil in the city) and the heart of an extensive ranching area. Calgary was founded in 1875 when the Royal Northwest Mounted Police established a fort at the junction of the Bow and Elbow Rivers. The Canadian-Pacific railroad reached Calgary in 1883; soon a bustling town had outgrown the fort to become the hub of cattle ranches and meat-packing plants. By 1891, the town had attracted 3,100 people. It was chartered as a city in 1893. By the 1950s, it had grown into a peaceful, prosperous provincial city of nearly 100,000.\nA U.S. consular agency was established at Lethbridge in 1891, soon after railway connections were opened to Great Falls, Montana. This later was closed, and a consulate was established in Calgary in 1906, a year after Alberta became a province. In 1963, that Consulate was made a consulate general. The consular district includes the Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba and the MacKenzie and Keewatin Districts of the Northwest Territories.\nCalgary was the host of the XV Winter Olympic Games in 1988. To prepare for this event, downtown office complexes, hotels, and department stores were connected by climate-controlled elevated skyways.\nEducation\nCalgary has a good public school system, which includes elementary, junior high, senior high, and combined junior and senior high schools. Tuition is free for all Calgary residents attending public schools. Instruction is in English, and in some schools, in French.\nPhysical education is compulsory through grade 10, after which it becomes an extra elective. Inter-school athletic competitions are an integral part of school life. French is, in general, the only language offered through grade 12. Two years of a foreign language are among the requirements for a high school diploma.  Music and art instruction is offered in all grades.\nSeveral private nursery schools and kindergartens are available. Nursery schools generally accept children from the age of three.\nThe Catholic Church maintains a separate system of elementary, junior high, combined elementary and junior high, and high schools. French and Latin are the only languages offered through grade 12. Textbooks are supplied free through grade nine, and no tuition fees are charged for Calgary residents.\nThe University of Calgary gives complete courses in arts, commerce, education, engineering, music, physical education, and science, premed. The student body totals about 20,000.\nThe Southern Alberta Institute of Technology provides educational programs in technology, art, business, trades, correspondence, instruction, and adult education. The institute is operated by the Alberta Department of Education and is financed by the provincial and federal governments.\nMount Royal Junior College is a public institution offering several types of programs: vocational training; high school completion at accelerated rate; course make-up while  studying at the University of Calgary; and a transfer program geared to enrollment at a degree-granting institution.\nThe Calgary School Board offers a wide range of evening courses and services, primarily in high schools. Academic subjects for adults as well as general interest courses are also offered at the University of Calgary and Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.\nCalgary has programs to aid the mentally and physically handicapped and children with learning disabilities. Special educational services provide alternative educational programs for children unable to cope with or benefit adequately from the regular school programs. Emphasis is placed at the elementary level, but programs for some students are available through grade 12. Schooling for the handicapped is also available at the Children's Hospital.\nRecreation\nFootball is the main spectator sport in Calgary, and the Stampeders play in the Western Conference of the Canadian Football League. Beginning with the 1980-81 season, Calgary also has a team in the National Hockey League. The Flames moved to the Canadian city from Atlanta, and play during the winter at the Saddledome, which was also used during the 1988 Winter Olympics.\nSeveral good horse shows are held during the year, and pari-mutuel horse racing is held regularly. Good public and private golf clubs are nearby; both the Banff Springs Hotel and Jasper Park Lodge have excellent courses.\nThe city has several tennis clubs. During the winter many enjoy badminton, curling, and ice skating. Boating and canoeing are also popular. Within the city, many parks and playgrounds have community swimming pools. Bowling, both five-pin and 10-pin, is popular. Downhill and cross-country skiing are available just outside the city limits, as well as on the slopes at Banff and Lake Louise. Several riding academies on nearby ranches offer lessons. Calgary also has an excellent planetarium and zoo.\nA spectacular annual event is the Calgary Stampede, held during the first part of July. This event, which began in 1912, has since grown into a 10-day celebration. Rodeo and western enthusiasts are drawn from all over Canada and the U.S. during this time, when the city completely surrenders to the spirit of the Old West. Besides rodeo programs and chuck wagon races, street dancing, chuck wagons selling flapjacks and bacon, and marching bands are popular. More than half-a-million Americans pass through Calgary every year to see the stampede and to enjoy nearby scenic attractions.\nWithin a few hours of Calgary, in the Canadian Rockies, are some of the most scenic areas of North America: Banff (also known as a center for native arts and crafts), Lake Louise, and Jasper National Park. Banff, about 75 miles to the northwest, may be reached by car in about one-and-a-half hours; another half-hour will take the traveler to Lake Louise. The \"Badlands\" at Drumheller, and the dinosaur burying ground, some 85 miles north and east, are also of interest, as is the Cypress Hills area in the southeastern corner of the province.\nTo the south, straddling the Canadian-U.S. border at the junction of Alberta, British Columbia, and Montana, is Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. This rustic recreation area comprises large park sites of both countries. The oil and natural gas fields in Turner Valley, just southwest of Calgary, are points of interest, as are the Pembina and Leduc oil fields to the north. The tourist may drive on the Alaska Highway to Dawson Creek and beyond. Excellent highways extend into British Columbia through beautiful scenery. The nearest U.S. border points from Calgary are the small Montana towns of Babb, 165 miles to the south, and Sweetgrass, 195 miles to the southeast. Other road mileages from Calgary are: Helena, Montana, 395; Great Falls, Montana, 330; Seattle, Washington, 760; Boise, Idaho, 680; and Salt Lake City, Utah, 995.\nEdmonton, Alberta's capital, is connected to Calgary by an excellent highway and frequent air service.\nBig-game hunting is possible, and antelope, caribou (woodland), bear (black and grizzly), deer, elk, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, and moose are found within easy driving distance of Calgary. On the flyway for millions of migratory water fowl, Alberta offers excellent hunting for several varieties of duck and geese. Pheasant, grouse, partridge, and ptarmigan are hunted in many areas.\nThe larger northern Alberta lakes are inhabited by huge northern pike and lake trout; pike, perch, and pickerel can be found in most Alberta lakes. In the Rocky Mountain lakes and streams are found Dolly Varden trout, rainbow trout, and grayling. The Bow River, which flows through Calgary, is one of the best rainbow trout streams in North America.\nCamping is popular in Alberta, and campsites are available in the three Rocky Mountain National Parks, as well as in 37 provincial parks. The national parks offer superb recreation throughout the year; entry permits, valid for a year, can be bought for a nominal fee.\nEntertainment\nCalgary has a philharmonic orchestra, a chamber music society, several choral groups, an amateur theater, an opera association, and a large number of movie houses. The permanent home of the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra is the splendid new Calgary Centre for the Performing Arts. In addition, traveling orchestras, ballets, and musicals visit the city each year. The Glen-bow Museum houses displays of Eskimo and Indian artifacts, as well as exhibits on ranching, railroads, farming, oil, and the mounted police.\nCalgary's Chinatown is small compared to those in Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal, but the restaurants on South Centre Street are lively late into the evening. There are very good Italian, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Mexican, and Vietnamese restaurants, and first-class French cuisine.\nCalgary has several public libraries. New works of fiction and nonfiction from Canadian, American, and British publishers are regularly added to the stacks. An almost complete array of U.S. magazines and pocketbooks can be found at most newsstands, department stores, and supermarkets.\nSocial contact between members of the American community is informal. The American Women's Club is a group of mainly longtime Calgary residents, many of whom are Canadian citizens.\nOther gatherings include both Canadians and Americans. Many opportunities exist for contributing voluntary time, skill, and effort to Canadian charitable and other activities. Rotary, Kiwanis, and Lions Clubs are active in the city. Several ranking men's clubs are available downtown, including the Calgary Petroleum Club, the Ranchman's Club, and the 400 Club.\nHalifax\nHalifax is the center of economic, political, and military activity in the Atlantic provinces. The capital of the province of Nova Scotia and the largest, most important city in the Atlantic region, Halifax is located on the south coast of the Nova Scotia peninsula. The city itself is a tiny peninsula with one of the finest natural harbors in the world.\nHalifax was founded in 1749 by Edward Cornwallis as a British stronghold, and became the capital of Nova Scotia in place of Annapolis Royal the following year. It was incorporated as a city in 1842 and has been an important Canadian naval base since 1910.\nBeginning life as a fort, its situation was so ideal for trade that, during the early 19th century, Halifax was the wealthiest part of Canada. Today, Halifax is an interesting mix of old and new. Province House where the Nova Scotia legislature meets, is a fine example of Georgian architecture. The residence of the lieutenant governor is also a beautiful building with lovely period furniture. The Old Town Clock on Citadel Hill, ordered by the Duke of Kent, father of Queen Victoria, during his tenure as commander of the Halifax Garrison, has been the symbol of Halifax for many years, but is now challenged by the towers of encroaching high-rise office and apartment buildings.\nThe Halifax Container port, Halifax Shipyards Ltd., and HMC Dockyard (the largest naval base in Canada) are the most important waterfront industries. Although Halifax spent the first half of the 20th century tearing down its old buildings, it is spending the latter half restoring those which are left. A fine example of this change of heart is the Historic Properties waterfront development, which features warehouses, banks, and other buildings of historic value.\nThe population of metropolitan Halifax (including its twin city of Dartmouth and other contiguous communities) is estimated at 321,000 (2000). The decline in merchant shipping has adversely affected the local economy, as have the recent severe problems in the fishing industry, an important one in this area. Nova Scotia now bases its hopes for economic prosperity on the gas finds off Sable Island, just as Newfoundland has great expectations founded on offshore oil. Although the oil glut has dimmed these hopes for the moment, exploration is still going on. Dartmouth, until recently best known as the bedroom of Halifax, is doing better with related industry which supplies the drilling rigs. Unlike Halifax which, cramped into its small peninsula, literally has no place to go, Dartmouth is able to provide space for industry in its Burnside Industrial Park. Halifax International Airport is located in Kelly Lake, about a 20-minute drive from Dartmouth.\nHalifax is the Atlantic regional headquarters of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC); the federal departments of Manpower and Immigration; Northern and Indian Affairs; Public Works; and Transport. It is also the principal military, rescue, and emergency planning headquarters of eastern Canada. The main office of the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council is in Halifax, as are the regional headquarters of many banks and corporations.\nThe U.S. consular district was originally established in 1827 as the first consular office in British North America. Now, it covers four of Canada's 10 provinces—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. The first three are known as the Maritime Provinces; along with Newfoundland, they are known as the Atlantic Provinces.\nEducation\nEducational opportunities are excellent in Halifax, which is the center of the largest concentration of institutions of higher learning in Atlantic Canada, attracting students and teachers from many parts of the world. This contributes to the area's growing cosmopolitan atmosphere.\nWithin the corporate boundaries of the city are seven degree-granting institutions—Dalhousie University (founded in 1818), St. Mary's University (founded in 1841), King's College, Nova Scotia Technical College (founded in 1907), Mount St. Vincent University (founded in 1873), Atlantic School of Theology, and the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. Also available is the Nova Scotia Institute of Technology.\nSchool attendance is compulsory for all children ages six to 16. The language of instruction for most of Nova Scotia is English. The Halifax public schools are divided into elementary schools and junior and   senior high schools. Vocational and technical training is offered by the provincially operated vocational school.\nTuition is free for Halifax residents. No school bus transportation is provided; students either walk or rely on public transportation. French instruction is available on a voluntary basis at all levels, and one school offers a French immersion program in elementary grades. It is anticipated that the program will expand gradually to include upper grades as well.\nThe Catholic Church operates one private school in Halifax—the Convent School of the Sacred Heart. Tuition is charged. The school offers classes for girls through grade 12, and for boys in grades primary to six.\nAnother private school is the Armbrae Academy. It is coeducational and offers classes for grades primary through twelve.\nHalifax has a number of nursery schools, one popular school being the Halifax Early Childhood School, on Inglis Street.\nSpecial education opportunities in Halifax include facilities for the mentally handicapped and those with learning disabilities, grades primary through nine, and for the physically handicapped, grades primary through 12. In addition, educational facilities are available for the emotionally disturbed and those with behavioral difficulties in grades one through nine. Transportation, if required, is available, and in very special cases, teaching in the home is possible.\nA school for the blind (primary to 11th grade) is also located in Halifax. An effort is made to keep visually handicapped children within the regular school system, particularly at the high school level. A school for the deaf, serving New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia, is located in Amherst, Nova Scotia, about 125 miles from Halifax.\nRecreation\nSeveral beaches are on both the south and east shores within two hours' drive of Halifax. Sea bathing is for the hardy only, since the water temperature is rarely over 65°F. Freshwater swimming is available at Grand Lake outside Halifax and in the Dartmouth Lakes. Indoor pools are located at the YMCA, the YWCA, and Centennial Pool. The Halifax Dalplex and the Dartmouth Sportsplex offer swimming, skating, and gym facilities, as well as exercise classes. Skating and curling clubs are popular. Outdoor skating on the various lakes is limited because of the changeable climate.\nMost of the city's leading business and professional people belong to one of two yacht clubs, the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron or the Armdale Club, even if they do not own boats.\nThe area has four golf clubs: a public club, the Ashburn Golf and Country Club in Halifax (the largest); Brightwood in Dartmouth; and a private club, Oakfield Golf and Country Club, Ltd., outside the city.\nA majority of the tennis courts are controlled by the tennis clubs and universities. Among the clubs with tennis courts are the South End Tennis Club, the Waegwoltic Club, St. Mary's Boat Club, and the  Northwest Arm Rowing Club. Indoor tennis is available at the Burnside Tennis Club in Dartmouth. Public tennis courts are located on the Halifax Common and at other parks throughout the city. Other court games available (at private clubs) are squash, handball, and badminton.\nPersons who have some skill in football, basketball, or hockey can join amateur leagues or club teams. Health-building programs and gym facilities are available at the local YMCA, YWCA, and at various health clubs. Nova Scotians are also interested in skating and curling. Many people join skating clubs. The ancient Scottish game of curling is entirely a club activity, and membership in either of two curling organizations is an easy way to get to know the Haligonians.\nWentworth, about 90 miles north of Halifax, and Mount Martoc near Windsor have limited skiing.\nHalifax is far from the larger Canadian and U.S. cities, but is well situated for excursions within the Maritimes. Its coastal scenery is beautiful, and the provinces contain many places of interest, with sailing, sunbathing, hunting, and fishing as the chief attractions. These points are not resort towns in the usual sense, so a car is useful. Bus transportation is available; railway travel is slow, except on the main line.\nTwo main highway routes connect most points of interest. One leads from Halifax to Yarmouth, on the southwestern end of the province, close to the famous tuna fishing grounds, then northeast along the Bay of Fundy through the apple-growing belt of the Annapolis Valley and Evangeline country. The Evangeline trail covers the country first colonized by the French. The oldest permanent settlement in North America was at Port Royal, and the French Habitation built there in 1605 has been reconstructed.\nThe other route leads northeast from Halifax, across the Strait of Canso and around the scenically magnificent Cabot Trail to Sydney, a city of about 35,000 and Cape Breton's steel center. Cape Breton Island, with its Cabot Trail, Louisbourg Fortress, and the Alexander Graham Bell Museum at Baddeck, is a very popular tourist attraction.\nHubbards, Chester, Mahone Bay, and Lunenburg, all with less than 5,000 population, lie along the Atlantic Coast, some 20 to 100 miles southwest of Halifax. These towns have comfortable accommodations for visitors in the tourist season, as do most Nova Scotian towns. Peggy's Cove and colorful fishing villages lie along the bays of the south coast.\nNova Scotia's 4,500 lakes, 50 rivers, and numerous streams offer fantastic fishing—shad, brook trout and, especially, Atlantic salmon. Some of the best smoked salmon can be found in the small Nova Scotian town of Tangier.\nIn New Brunswick, Fundy National Park, maintained by the federal government, features camping facilities, hiking, boating, horseback riding, nature trails, and many other worthwhile recreational activities. New Brunswick also has a number of festivals related to the area's fishing industry, including the Shediac Lobster Festival and the Campbellton Salmon Festival. Not far away is the former summer home of President Franklin D. Roosevelt at Campobello Island, now maintained jointly by the U.S. and Canada. The picturesque resort town of St. Andrews-by-the-Sea, with its white frame houses, reminds the visitor of the U.S. New England states.\nPrince Edward Island (P.E.I.), the garden province, is alive with activity in the summertime, with its many museums, beaches, parks, and theaters. Music camps and the Atlantic Canada Institute Summer School are held in July at the University of P.E.I. Country Days and Old Home Week feature music, agricultural displays, handicrafts, and parades. The Anne of Green Gables Festival, along with lobster, strawberry, and potato blossom festivals and craft fairs, are also part of its summer attractions. P.E.I. is a favorite vacation spot for young families.\nNewfoundland offers many opportunities for camping, hunting, fishing, and sight-seeing. Its capital, St. John's, is a good base from which to explore the province's scenic and historic Avalon Peninsula.\nYear-round ferry service to Port Aux Basques on Newfoundland's southwest coast is offered from North Sydney, Nova Scotia. Many summertime visitors to Newfoundland, however, prefer to take the ferry which operates during summer months from North Sydney to Argentia, Newfoundland, an Avalon Peninsula port (in Placentia Bay near the site where Roosevelt and Churchill drafted the Atlantic Charter), only 85 miles from St. John's. Newfoundland's annual regatta is one of the oldest sporting events in North America.\nAir service is provided by Air Canada and Eastern Provincial Airways to numerous cities in the Atlantic Provinces. Two ferry services connect Nova Scotia with Prince Edward Island at two points: one, operating throughout the year, crosses from Cape Tormentine in New Brunswick to Port Borden, about 35 miles to the west of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island; the other, which operates only when there is no ice, crosses from Pictou, Nova Scotia, to Woods Island, about 35 miles southeast of Charlottetown.\nEntertainment\nHalifax has a professional repertory theater, The Neptune, and is the home of Symphony Nova Scotia, a professional orchestra, recently formed under the musical direction of Boris Brott, a well-known and talented Canadian conductor. The orchestra performs chamber music as well as symphonic programs. Rebecca Cohn Auditorium, located  at Dalhousie University, is the locale for various kinds of entertainment, including concerts by such well-known Canadians as André Gagnon and Liona Boyd. An ensemble called Nova Music performs classical music by contemporary composers. Distinguished films are shown in the auditorium on Sunday nights.\nDalhousie University, St. Mary's University, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) sponsor concert series throughout the season which feature international and national artists. Local amateur groups also present plays and operettas. Spectator sports include football, basketball, hockey, boxing, and wrestling. The various university and service teams compete in amateur football, basketball, and baseball.\nSeveral movie theaters in Halifax and Dartmouth show current American and British films. Nova Scotia is also the home of the Annapolis Apple Blossom Festival and the Highland Games.\nTwo Canadian television stations have studios in Halifax, and there are several radio stations in the metro area, both AM and FM. Halifax Cablevision Limited provides a cable service which picks up the U.S. public broadcasting channel, NBC, and ABC from Maine transmitters. French-language broadcasts are presented on radio and TV.\nThe Halifax Memorial Library, established in 1951, offers free library service from its collection of about 130,000 volumes. It has a good selection of late and current fiction and nonfiction and an excellent reference section. A mobile service for the city and the county has been operating for several years. Books are available at local bookstores, but cost 20% more than in the U.S.\nArt exhibits are held at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia and at various universities.\nSome excellent restaurants are located in Halifax, specializing in seafood delicacies and French cuisine.\nWinnipeg\nMetropolitan Winnipeg is the fifth largest city in Canada, ranking after Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Calgary. It is known worldwide for its seemingly endless wheat fields, its blizzards, and its hockey team, the Jets.\nA fur trading post was established on the site of modern-day Winnipeg in 1738, and later a colony was founded by the Scots. The village of Winnipeg was settled in the late 1860s, and incorporated as a city in 1873.\nWinnipeg resembles cities of comparable size in the middle western plains in the U.S. Situated on the eastern edge of an 800-mile stretch of prairie-land, it is the home of the Canadian Wheat Board and the Board of Grain Commissioners. Winnipeg is also located almost midway between the two oceans, near the geographical center of North America. Its people are friendly and hospitable. Their interests, habits, and mode of life are similar to those of the American Westerner.\nThe capital of the Province of Manitoba, Winnipeg is situated at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, about 70 miles north of the international boundary. It is 485 miles, by car, from Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is 760 feet above sea level, and the surrounding area within a 100-mile perimeter is flat, broken by occasional wooded areas and streams. The area has a healthy climate, comparable to that of Minneapolis, although colder. Winter temperatures drop to as low as 40°F or more below zero. Winters are fairly dry and summers are cool and pleasant.\nGreater Winnipeg's population was about 652,400 in 2000. English is the principal language spoken in the city. However, in St. Boniface, a part of metropolitan Winnipeg, more than 40% of the present population is of French or Belgian ancestry, and most people speak French as well as English.\nAlthough about 40% of Winnipeg's population is British in origin, with a strong Scottish strain, there are a number of other nationalities, including Ukrainians, Germans, French, Italians, Dutch, Philippines, Vietnamese, and Chinese. There is no American colony as such in Winnipeg. In fact, the social, economic, and cultural background of the city is practically the same as in the contiguous areas of the U.S. There is a constant shift of population in both directions across the border, and estimates place the number of persons in the district with claim to U.S. citizenship above 10,000. Upwards of one-and-a-half million American tourists have annually visited the Province of Manitoba.\nEducation\nWinnipeg's good, free education for kindergarten through grade 12 is comparable to American standards. Two nondenominational private schools and two Roman Catholic schools are also of good reputation. The nondenominational school for girls, Balmoral High School, has classes from kindergarten through grade 12. The Roman Catholic school, St. Mary's Academy for Girls, provides facilities for grades seven through 12. St. John's Raven-scourt School for Boys (and girls from grades nine through 12) provides excellent education from grades one through 12. St. Paul's College (Roman Catholic) provides education for boys and young men (grades nine through 11 and through university). Tuition and annual fees at private schools are slightly lower than those in the U.S.\nSpecial educational opportunities are available in each school division in Winnipeg for children who have learning disabilities or who are mentally or physically handicapped. Special educational institutions are also available for severely physically  handicapped or mentally retarded children.\nWinnipeg has two universities. The University of Manitoba, is the oldest university in Western Canada. Founded in 1877, it is a first-class provincially operated institution and offers a large number of undergraduate and graduate programs. The University of Winnipeg, located in the center of the city, is a relatively new institution (founded in 1967), with undergraduate courses in the liberal arts and pre-professional education.\nRed River Community College specializes in practical courses for both degree and nondegree students. All three institutions have evening and summer sessions.\nVarious levels of instruction are offered at the Winnipeg School of Ballet. Students taking private lessons in music may take examinations leading to the certificate of Associate of the Toronto Conservatory of Music. The University of Manitoba gives a bachelor's degree (AMM) in music. The Winnipeg Art Gallery also offers art classes.\nRecreation\nWinnipeg offers numerous and varied year-round recreational facilities for adults as well as children. Nearly every residential neighborhood has school playgrounds and local community clubs where instruction is given to children in handicrafts, dancing, skating, hockey, football, tennis, and other sports. Four large and some small parks, the largest of which is Assiniboine Park (which has a fine zoo, formal gardens, and conservatory), provide pleasant surroundings for picnicking, sports, and walking. All parks are conveniently served by local transportation.\nGolf, tennis, swimming, and boating are the most popular summer sports in Winnipeg. Golf may be played at several very good municipal courses or at a number of semiprivate clubs where reasonable greens fees are charged. Winnipeg has a number of neighborhood wading pools, one large municipal outdoor pool, and several indoor pools. An Olympic-size indoor pool, one of the largest in the world and the site of the 1967 Pan American Games' swimming events, is located in the city.\nSeveral local skiing clubs teach the fundamentals of skiing and jumping on the banks of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, but it is necessary to travel some distance from the city for really good downhill skiing conditions. Cross-country skiing is popular in and around Winnipeg. Indoor sports such as badminton, squash, bowling, curling, and roller skating may also be enjoyed.\nExcellent hunting abounds in Manitoba. Deer, moose, and even polar bear are found in the north. Duck, geese, prairie chicken, and grouse are found only a few hours' drive from Winnipeg in some of the best hunting regions in Canada. Good fishing can be found throughout the district, and both open water and ice fishing are very popular.\nThe Precambrian Shield, 50 miles east of the city, is an area of woods, rocks, and lakes. The nearest resort area is the district on the southern shores of Lake Winnipeg, about 35 miles to the north by road, where many people have small cottages. There are limited bathing facilities in several of the beach towns.\nThe western section of the very attractive Lake of the Woods area is about 120 miles east of Winnipeg and easily accessible by car, bus, or train. Among the pleasant resorts closest to Winnipeg are Kenora, Whiteshell Forest Reserve and, to the west, Riding Mountain National Park. Many attractive summer homes are found throughout the area. Hotel accommodations are good; motels are satisfactory. Most resort spots offer special camping facilities.\nTo the north, places such as Flin Flon, a copper-zinc-gold mining center, and Fort Churchill on Hudson Bay are interesting places to visit. There is a good paved road to Flin Flon (560 miles) and to Thompson (a nickel mining town), but Fort Churchill is reached only by rail or air. Each year a few rail excursions of several days' duration are run to Churchill, with the tourists living on the train. The Selkirk Navigation Company operates a five-day cruise on Lake Winnipeg during June, July, August, and September. Accommodations on the modern Lord Selkirk are comfortable.\nNorthwest of Winnipeg, at the south end of Lake Dauphin, is the town of Dauphin (population 9,000). Known for barley, timber, and fisheries, Dauphin is also host to Canada's National Ukrainian Festival, held annually in August.\nEntertainment\nWinnipeg prides itself as being \"The Convention City\" and, as might be expected, it offers a wide variety of entertainment opportunities. These include the internationally renowned Royal Winnipeg Ballet, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Manitoba Theater Center, the Contemporary Dancers, and the Opera. Performances are usually held in the Concert Hall and the Manitoba Theater Center, both located at the Centennial Center adjacent to City Hall. There is also an open-air theater—Rainbow Stage—where plays, musicals, and other attractions are held during the summer.\nAlso in the Centennial Center is the Museum of Man and Nature, which offers a wide variety of exhibits on the general theme of man in relation to the environment. There are several other museums in the city, the most impressive of which is the new and strikingly handsome Winnipeg Art Gallery.\nThe city's ethnic diversity is reflected in the variety of festivals held throughout the year, including Festival du Voyageur (a winter festival in St. Boniface), Ukrainian Week, and Folklorama, a major event each summer, during which pavilions representing various ethnic groups provide entertainment in the form of traditional songs, dancing, and food.\nProbably the most popular attraction in the city is hockey, with its National Hockey League franchise, the Jets. The Winnipeg Arena is located on Maroons Road, named after a senior hockey team which brought honor to the city 20 years ago. When the Jets joined the NHL, the roof of Winnipeg Arena was raised and 5,400 additional seats were installed. This brought the arena up to NHL standards of at least 15,000 seats.\nOther spectator sports include football and curling games, as well as thoroughbred racing at Assiniboine Downs.\nThere are about 15 motion picture theaters in the city. Several of these are first class and feature the latest American and, on occasion, European films.

Water pollution problems have, occasionally, been serious. Those concerned about swimming in this region or eating locally caught fish are advised to contact appropriate provincial agencies. Known as the \"Salmon Capital of Ontario,\" the city is host to the annual Sarnia Salmon Derby in May. Thousands of sailors and spectators descend upon the city for the Port Huron-to-Mackinac Race each summer. The population is estimated at about 80,000.\nSASKATOON , in Saskatchewan, is the potash capital of the world. Half of the world's potash reserve is located in this area. Industries located in Saskatoon include food and dairy processing, flour milling, brewing, tanning, oil refining, and meat-packing. The city also manufactures electronic equipment fertilizers, clothing, and chemicals. Saskatoon is the home of the Mendel Art Gallery, which houses a collection of works by Canadian artists. Other museums in Saskatoon include the Ukrainian Museum of Canada, which has contemporary and historical exhibits dealing with the early settlement of Saskatchewan and culture on the Ukrainian people, and the Western Development Museum, which features a \"Boom Town\" that recreates a 1910 village. Saskatoon also hosts several annual fairs, and festivals which attract tourists and natives alike. The city offers numerous opportunities for fine dining. The population is about 194,000; the city is the birthplace of hockey great Gordie Howe.\nSAULT SAINTE MARIE was established on the site of a mission founded by Pere Jacques Marquette in 1668. It is situated at the falls on the St. Mary's River (the link between Lakes Huron and Superior), just opposite Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan. This is the site of one of the most active canals in the St. Lawrence Seaway system; lake freighters traveling to and from the upper Great Lakes use the locks to bypass the rapids. Tours of the locks are available. Two-hour cruises through both the American and Canadian locks, the world's busiest, are offered from late May until Thanksgiving. The Canadian lock, located at the edge of the St. Mary's River rapids, was completed in 1895 and is the oldest in the system. A pretty city with many old stone and brick buildings, Sault Sainte Marie's economy depends upon the Algoma steel plant, lumber, agriculture, and tourism. Although the city is considered part of the summer resort system, it also has many wintertime events. World class cross-country skiing trails are numerous and the downhill skiing is excellent. Groomed trails for snowmobiling are available. The Ontario Winter Carnival Bon Soo, featuring dog sled races, speed skating, polar bear swimming, and more is held here in late January/early February. To the east of Sault Sainte Marie, on the North Channel of Lake Huron, are several resort and vacation centers. Bruce Mines was named for Canada's first successful copper mines. Thessalon, a lumber town situated at the river mouth, has a large government wharf and marina. Iron Bridge, on the historic Mississagi River, is known for its sturgeon fishing. Blind River is a mining and lumbering center. A short distance inland is Elliot Lake, founded in 1954 when uranium deposits were discovered nearby. A modern town of 20,000 on the shore of one of the 170 lakes in the area, Elliot Lake offers winter and summer sports activities.\nSTRATFORD , Ontario, is located just north of London on the Avon River. Founded in 1832, the city produces furniture, brass, and leather and rubber goods. It is best known, however, for its deliberate resemblance to Stratford-upon-Avon, England, the home of William Shakespeare. The Stratford Shakespearean Festival in Ontario began modestly in 1953 and has since become a major world theatrical event, utilizing three theaters. While still based on a Shakespearean season, the festival now incorporates diverse forms of music and theater, from folk-singing to opera. The season runs from June through October. Stratford's population is over 27,000.\n\"The nickel capital of the world,\" SUDBURY is 40 miles north of  Georgian Bay in south-central Ontario. The city has a population of roughly over 90,000, and is in the middle of the country's most important mining region. Minerals were first discovered here in 1883; today, in addition to nickel, copper, gold, cobalt, sulfur, iron ore, silver, and platinum are mined. Industries include lumber milling, woodworking, brickworking, and machine shops. Sudbury is linked to other cities by the Trans-Canada Highway, as well as by two transcontinental railways. It acts as the area's main commercial and educational center.\nTHE FORD MINES is a mining community of 20,000, 50 miles south of Quebec City in southern Quebec province. It is known as one of the world's major asbestos-producing regions, but also mines chromium and feldspar (a crystalline mineral). Dairying, chromium and feldspar mining, saw milling, and fiberglass manufacturing are other commercial activities in Thetford Mines. It was founded in 1876 and became a city in 1912.\nTHOMPSON lies on the Burntwood River, 400 miles north of Winnipeg, in north-central Manitoba. This planned community was built in the late 1950s and has an estimated population of 14,700. The International Nickel Company is the principal employer. Its chairman, John Thompson, gave his name for the city when it was completed in 1961. The company's combination nickel mining-smelting-refining plant was the first of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. Thompson is linked to Winnipeg by air.\nTHUNDER BAY is Canada's third largest port, and the western terminus of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The twin cities of Port Arthur and Fort William joined to form Thunder Bay on January 1, 1970. The city is located in the midst of a rich mining and fishing region. Several industries in Thunder Bay are involved in brewing, flour milling, paper milling, truck and aircraft manufacturing, and shipbuilding. The city is easily accessible by boat, highway, and rail. It has an estimated population of 114,000.\nTROIS RIVIÈRES (Three Rivers), in Quebec, is the second oldest city in the province. Founded in 1634, it is predated only by Quebec City, which was established in 1608. The city has a strong manufacturing base. Factories in Trois Rivières produce clothing, electrical appliances, paper, textiles, shoes, and wood pulp. Abundant woodlands, combined with a large hydroelectric plant make the city one of the world's largest producers of news-print. It has a beautiful 17th-century Anglican church, and a Gothic-style cathedral whose stained-glass windows are among the most exquisite on this continent. Approximately 51,800 people live in the city.\nWHITEHORSE , the capital of the Yukon, is headquarters for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Its population is roughly 20,700. The Yukon was the site of the Klondike Gold Rush in 1898. The Gay Nineties days are relived every summer. Dramond Tooth Gerties in Dawson is a gambling casino, with blackjack and roulette tables. Other points of interest in Whitehorse include the McBride Museum, which features an in depth look at Yukon heritage and wildlife, a tour aboard the restored steamboat S.S. Klondike and a guided tour of the city.\nYELLOWKNIFE , capital of the Northwest Territories, is one of Canada's youngest cities (1935). It is only 275 miles south of the Arctic Circle. From May through July, this is the land of the midnight sun. In late June, Yellowknife hosts the Pacific Western Midnight Sun Golf Tournament. The Northwest Territories covers one-third of Canada's land area, but the total population is only about 14,000. Coppermine, Cambridge Bay, Bathurst Inlet, and Bay Chimo are small communities north of Yellowknife.\nCOUNTRY PROFILE\nGeography and Climate\nThe world's second largest country in land area (3,851,809 square miles), Canada is bordered on the north by the Arctic Ocean, on the northeast by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the United States, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean and Alaska.\nMuch of Canada's industry is concentrated in the southeast near the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, in an environment similar to adjacent areas of the U.S. To the northeast are the rolling Appalachian country of southern Quebec, the Maritime Provinces, and the Island of Newfoundland. The most outstanding physical feature is the Shield, a rugged area of Precambrian rock which surrounds Hudson Bay and covers most of eastern and central Canada—almost half of the country. This semi-barren area, and the Arctic Archipelago to the north, are sparsely populated and as yet largely undeveloped.\nAnother major region is the Canadian prairies, an extension of the mid-continent Great Plains. This area lies between the western border of the Shield and the Canadian Rockies. It is the Canadian bread-basket, and an area that is also rich in petroleum, gas, and other mineral resources.\nFar-western Canada, comprised mostly of British Columbia, is laced with towering mountain ranges. Most people here live on the temperate southwest coast and Vancouver Island.\nThe climate varies greatly in the many diversified regions—ranging from frigid to mild—but Canada generally may be described as lying in the cool temperate zone, with long, cold winters.\nPopulation\nMore than two-thirds of Canada's 31.3 million people live within 100 miles of the U.S. border. Canadians and Americans are not \"just alike,\" however, as many observers often assume. The Canadian character and outlook have been forged from a distinctive historical and social background which has produced a \"Canadian way of life\" that flourishes in a sovereign nation.\nAbout 28% of the population is of British stock, about 23% of French, 15% is other European, and about 2% is indigenous Indian and Inuits (Eskimos). Canada's more than six million French-speaking citizens are mainly descendants of colonists who settled the country three centuries ago. They are concentrated in the Province of Quebec, although about 20% live in other parts of the country, mainly Ontario and New Brunswick. There is a sizeable French community in Manitoba as well.\nThe English-speaking population has been built up by immigration from the British Isles. The largest influx from the U.S. occurred during the American Revolution, when thousands of \"Empire Loyalists\" fled to Canada. Most settled in \"Upper Canada,\" in southern and southeastern Ontario. Those Canadians who are of neither British nor French origin are mainly Germans, Ukrainians, Scandinavians, Italians, Dutch, Poles, Chinese, Indians, and Pakistanis.\nReligion plays an important, though diminishing, role in the life of the Canadian. About 42% are Roman Catholics. The largest Protestant denomination, about 17% of the population, is the United Church of Canada—a union of Methodists, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians. Almost 10% are Anglicans, with Presbyterians, Lutherans, Baptists, and Jews next in number.\nGovernment\nCanada's parliamentary system of government reflects both its Old World heritage and its North American experience. The British North America Act of 1867 provided a written constitution, similar to that of the British. The lack of specific guarantees of rights, combined with profound regional disputes, led to serious consideration of a truly Canadian constitution in the late 1970s. After years of discussions, then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau \"brought home the constitution\" in 1982. Following British Parliament approval, Queen Elizabeth II and Trudeau signed the Constitution Act on Ottawa's Parliament Hill in April 1982. Included in the new constitution is a Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\nMany of the country's legal and parliamentary practices are derived from ancient custom, as in Great Britain. On the other hand, the 10 provinces are united in a federal system resembling that in the U.S., though provinces have greater responsibilities and powers than have American states.\nQueen Elizabeth II is the head of the Canadian state, and is a symbol of Canada's Commonwealth status. Her personal representative in Canada is the Governor-General.\nParliament consists of the Crown, the Senate, and the House of Commons, the latter clearly having the dominant voice in legislation. Its 282 members are elected for nominal five-year terms. The Senate's 104 members are appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister, and hold office until mandatory retirement at age 75.\nExecutive power is vested in the Cabinet, headed by the prime minister, who is the leader of the political party in power. The Cabinet remains in power as long as it retains majority support in the House on major issues.\nProvincial government is patterned much along the lines of the central government. Each province is governed by a premier and a single, elected legislative chamber. A lieutenant governor, appointed by the governor-general, represents the Crown.\nCriminal law, a parliamentary prerogative, is uniform throughout the nation, and is largely based on British law. Civil law is based on English common law, except in Quebec. Here, civil law is derived from the Napoleonic Code. Justice is administered by federal, provincial, and municipal courts.\nDuring the past century, national politics has been dominated by two major parties, the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives. While these parties have adopted many traditions from their British counterparts, there are substantial differences. The Liberals correspond, in very general terms, to the Democratic Party in the U.S., while the Progressive Conservatives would be the rough equivalent of the Republican Party. Distinctions between the two parties, however, are increasingly blurred since both take a pragmatic approach to Canada's problems.\nAlso represented in parliament and active in provincial politics is the New Democratic Party (NDP). The NDP corresponds roughly to the social democratic parties of Europe. The Communist Party is almost insignificant, and holds no seat in either the federal or provincial legislatures.\nCanada is a member of the British Commonwealth, the United Nations, United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), World Health Organization (WHO), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the following international associations: Inter-American Development Bank, International Energy Agency, International Sugar Organization, International Wool Study Group, and the International Wheat Council.\nThe Canadian flag consists of a red maple leaf on a white background, flanked by vertical bands of red.\nArts, Science, Education\nThe development of the arts in Canada reflects not only the country's culture and geography, but also bears the imprint of a rapidly growing nation. The existence of two dominant cultural traditions—French and English—has led to a diversity in the arts. Focal points of artistic activity have grown up in several metropolitan centers scattered about the country. Since World War II, economic growth has given Canadians greater means to practice and enjoy the arts, and the influx of immigrants has increased the pool of available talent.\nAll provincial governments, through various departments, agencies, or educational institutions, provide some assistance for professional and amateur artists within their borders. The federally funded, as well as privately funded, Canada Council administers a similar program on a national scale.\nWell-known artistic groups include the Stratford Festival Company, the Montreal Symphony, Toronto's Canadian Opera Company, and the Winnipeg Ballet. All of these groups make extensive tours throughout North America, and occasionally tour abroad.\nA technologically advanced nation, Canada needs and produces much scientific activity. Most major research projects reflect the increasingly interdependent industrial, university, and government laboratories. In addition, considerable scientific cooperation is undertaken with other nations—especially with the U.S. and the U.K.\nAll of Canada's activities in the field of atomic energy are the responsibility of the federal government. The most diversified program of scientific research is carried out by the National Research Council—a federal agency. On the other hand, most basic medical research is conducted by universities.\nEducation at the elementary and secondary level is the responsibility of provincial governments; curricula and teacher qualifications vary a great deal. In all provinces, public education is free. Ages of mandatory attendance vary from province to province, but are generally from seven to 15. In Halifax, Vancouver, and Winnipeg, free public education is controlled and funded by public school boards, as in the U.S. Private schools, primarily Roman Catholic, exist as well, and charge tuition. The literacy rate is estimated to be 99%.\nIn other Canadian cities, free public education is funded and controlled locally by two types of boards—either \"public\" or \"separate.\" Except in Quebec, the public boards are nondenominational, reflecting a Protestant and English historical development; the separate boards are Roman Catholic. In Quebec, the public boards are Roman Catholic—further divided into boards for French-and English-speaking children; the separate boards are nondenominational, also with French and English subdivisions. Both types of boards fund public education from property taxes. Parents usually cannot elect to send children in the same family to schools controlled by different boards.\nEducation at the elementary level in Canada is considered to be on a par with schools in the U.S. At the secondary level, schools in Ontario and the western provinces are also considered to be at par, but in Montreal, Quebec City, and Halifax, schools at the secondary level do not always meet these standards.\nIn the non-French-speaking areas of Ottawa, Toronto, and Winnipeg, local school districts offer French-language instruction at all levels. In elementary schools, there are generally two tracks of instruction—a required French course, or an optional immersion program, which begins in kindergarten and offers instruction totally in French, with English being phased in gradually in the third or fourth grade. At the secondary level, French is usually optional and is offered along with other languages, such as German and Spanish. At other places (outside Quebec), French is offered on an optional basis, primarily at the secondary level. In English-speaking schools in Quebec Province, French is also a required subject at all levels.\nCanada's 60 universities range from small liberal arts colleges with as few as 1,000 students to multiversities (made up of colleges, faculties, and research institutes) with enrollments as high as 20,000. Most instruction is in English—although some institutions use French only—whereas both English and French are used at the University of Ottawa and two other institutions. There are numerous community colleges, usually called technical schools.\nCommerce and Industry\nThe Canadian economy is highly developed, giving Canadians one of the highest standards of living in the world. Manufacturing is concentrated in transportation and communications equipment, engineering, and steel and consumer goods. Especially notable is the production of motor vehicles and parts, encouraged by the auto pact between the U.S. and Canada. Most manufacturing is concentrated in Ontario and Quebec.\nAlberta is growing fast in industries related to oil and natural gas. Primary industries built on Canada's rich natural resources remain an important part of the economy and a major source of exports. Leading resource industries are: forest products; oil, natural gas, and hydroelectric power; grains and other agricultural products; mining of asbestos, potash, and nonferrous metals; and fishing. As in other developed countries, the service sector is growing rapidly.\nThe economy is closely linked by trade and investment with other countries, especially the U.S. Foreign  trade, two-thirds of which is with the U.S., represents more than one-fifth of total output. There is considerable two-way direct investment between the U.S. and Canada, although the level of U.S. investment in Canada is higher, as is its relative importance in the economy.\nAmericans find that most products and services available in the U.S. are also available in Canada. Local prices are often higher, but this may be offset by a favorable exchange rate for the Canadian dollar.\nThe main office of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce is located at 55 Metcalf St., Ste. 1160, Ottawa, Ontario K1P 6N4. There are regional offices in all of the provinces.\nTransportation\nExcept in the remote northern areas, Canada possesses an advanced transportation system in all modes comparable to that in the U.S. An extensive air network links all major and many minor traffic points with adequate connections to the rest of the world. Domestic air fares per mile are higher than in the U.S., and distances between population centers are considerably greater. A good highway system (with somewhat less emphasis on interstate-type roads) exists, and supports extensive truck, bus, and automobile traffic.\nThe Canadian railroad system, while vast, has many problems similar to those affecting the U.S. Although passenger service continues to exist, it is poor except in the Quebec-Windsor corridor.\nWater transportation is important largely from the foreign trade viewpoint. Major ports exist at Vancouver, Montreal, other St. Lawrence River points, Halifax, and St. John (New Brunswick). The Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway and River System is an important domestic and binational transport route, which permits the movement of smaller-sized oceangoing vessels as far west as Duluth, Minnesota and Thunder Bay, Ontario.\nAll larger cities have public transit systems, generally buses. There are subways in Montreal and Toronto, and streetcars in Toronto and Calgary; plans are being formulated to develop rail systems in Edmonton and elsewhere. By and large, Canadian cities have public transportation arrangements at least as good as in American cities of similar size. They are better developed closer to the city's downtown center. Low population densities have inhibited the development of equivalent service in distant suburbs. The operation of public transport is frequently subsidized by provincial and local governments, making most fares reasonable.\nIn spite of extensive public transportation arrangements, Canada is as much an automobile society as the U.S. All American automobile manufacturers have plants in Canada, producing standard North American vehicles, and the greater portion of the automobile market in Canada is shared by these manufacturers. Most European and Japanese models found in the U.S. are also sold in Canada. Spare parts are available for all these vehicles. Repair facilities in the major cities compare to those in the U.S. There may be service problems with some European and Japanese cars outside the major cities, but most cars can be serviced readily except, perhaps, in remote areas.\nU.S. grades of gasoline (leaded and unleaded) are widely available, and are sold in liters. Safety standards for cars are similar in the U.S. and Canada. Left-hand-drive vehicles are standard; traffic moves on the right. International highway symbols are used in Canada, and distances have been converted to the metric system. Seat belts and infant/child seat restraints are mandatory in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia. Fines are imposed for non-use of seat belts and child restraints.\nCommunications\nTelephone service, provided by the Bell Telephone Company of Canada in Ontario and Quebec, and by provincial companies in other provinces, is excellent. Canada (except for the Northwest Territories) is integrated with the U.S. direct distance dialing system. Telegraph services are operated by the two transcontinental railway companies, and by the federal government to outlying districts.\nMail service within and from Canada to other countries is satisfactory. All first-class mail is airmail within Canada at no extra cost, and letters to the U.S. require only a regular first-class stamp. There is no censorship, and customs formalities are minimal.\nBroadcasting is well developed in Canada. Radio and TV stations operate in all major cities and carry extensive amounts of U.S. programming. There are two national TV networks (CBC and CTV), and independent TV stations also exist in many large cities. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) operates an extensive radio network, with domestic (AM and FM), northern, and international short-wave service. It operates dual networks for English and French programming; there are even French outlets in the western cities where the francophone population is limited. The Province of Quebec also has its own French-language broadcasting system. The Province of Ontario operates an impressive educational TV system which, at night, features nonacademic programs.\nDirect reception of nearby U.S. radio and TV stations is possible in many parts of Canada. In most Canadian cities there is a well-developed cable TV system which relays most of the U.S. networks (including PBS), some distant Canadian stations for an additional charge, and distant FM radio as well.\nAbout 109 daily newspapers are published in Canada—89% are in  English, the rest in French. Most major cities have at least two local papers, usually morning and evening. Ottawa has only one daily, The Citizen. About six Canadian newspapers publish a Sunday edition. Most cities receive major U.S. newspapers within a few days of publication. (The New York Times is available daily, including Sundays, in Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal.)\nMost American magazines and books are available, but usually at slightly higher prices. Maclean's, a biweekly, is the only national Canadian news magazine. Reader's Digest publishes a Canadian edition.\nHealth\nMedical care in Canada is excellent. Competent doctors, dentists, and specialists in all fields are available, and most, except in some areas of Quebec, speak English. Canadian medical educational standards are equivalent to those in the U.S., particularly in dentistry and ophthalmology. There is a shortage of trained personnel and facilities in the physical rehabilitation field, although availability of these services has improved in recent years.\nLaboratories and hospitals maintain high standards and are well equipped. Professional fees and hospital and prescription drug costs are comparable to those in the U.S. Pharmaceutical facilities are excellent.\nThere are no special health risks. Standards of community health and sanitation are very good, and no diseases are endemic to large cities; however, several possible health problems should be noted. Winnipeg's climate might affect visitors seriously afflicted with asthma, sinusitis, or Raynaud's disease, a circulatory vascular condition. Hay fever sufferers should remember that Toronto has the highest pollen count of any large North American city. While the hay fever season is short—about six weeks—persons with hay fever experience great discomfort unless they take medication or remain in air-conditioned areas.\nClothing and Services\nAmericans find that tastes and standards in clothing are basically the same as in the U.S. The climate in winter makes warm clothes essential. For the most part, summers are somewhat cooler in Canada, but hot periods occur, and lightweight clothing is necessary. Wraps are usually needed for evenings, even in summer. Children dress casually, as in the U.S., but those who attend private schools ordinarily wear uniforms.\nReady-made clothes of all kinds are available at every price level. Items manufactured in the U.S. are expensive—often one-third higher than the American retail price.\nPractically all services and supplies are available in the cities throughout Canada. The prices are often higher, but the current favorable exchange rate offsets the expense. Domestic help is difficult to find (as in the U.S.), and if the level of competence and experience is favorable, wages also are high. Professional catering and cleaning services are available.\nNOTES FOR TRAVELERS\nPassage, Customs & Duties\nWhen entering from the United States, U.S. citizens must show either a U.S. passport or proof of U.S. citizenship and photo ID. U.S. citizens entering Canada from a third country must have a valid passport. A visa is not required for U.S. citizens for a stay up to 180 days. Anyone with a criminal record (including a DWI charge) should contact the Canadian Embassy or nearest Canadian consulate before travel. For further information on entry requirements, travelers may contact the Embassy of Canada at 501 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001, telephone (202) 682-1740, Internet address:http://www.cdnemb-washdc.org; or the Canadian consulates in Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York, San Juan or Seattle.\nU.S. citizens living in or visiting Canada may register at the Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy or at a U.S. Consulate General in Canada, and may obtain updated information on travel and security within Canada.\nThe U.S. Embassy is in Ottawa, Ontario, at 490 Sussex Drive, K1N 1G8, telephone (613) 238-5335, fax (613) 688-3082.

The consular district includes British Columbia and the Yukon Territory.\nPets\nDogs and cats imported from the U.S. must be accompanied by a veterinarian's certificate showing that the dog or cat has been vaccinated against rabies during the three years preceding entry. From countries recognized by Canada to be free of rabies, a certificate issued by a veterinarian of the National Veterinary Service of the country of origin is required, certifying that the animal has been in that country for a continuous six-month period preceding shipment. From all other countries, a certificate issued by a veterinarian of the National Veterinary Service should certify that the animal was vaccinated against rabies not less than 30 days nor more than one year preceding shipment. Dogs and cats from countries other than the U.S. arriving without a certificate will be placed in quarantine for a 30-day period and vaccinated for rabies.\nFirearms & Ammunition\nFirearms are strictly controlled. As of January 1, 2001, visitors bringing firearms into Canada, or planning to borrow and use firearms while in Canada, are required to declare the firearms in writing using a Non-Resident Firearm Declaration form. Multiple firearms can be declared on the same form. At the border, three copies of the unsigned declaration must be presented to a Canadian Customs officer. The declaration will serve as a temporary license and registration certificate for up to 60 days. The Non-Resident Firearm Declaration costs $50 (Canadian). Visitors planning to borrow a firearm in Canada must obtain in advance a Temporary Firearms Borrowing License, which costs $30 (Canadian). The form must be signed before a Canadian Customs officer and the fee paid at the border. In order to save time at the border, Canadian authorities recommend that visitors complete the declaration form, but not sign it, and make two copies of the completed form before arriving at the port-of-entry. Requests made at the border for photocopies of the form may be denied. Full details on this new policy are available at the Canadian Firearms Centre web site,http://www.cfc-ccaf.gc.ca, under the heading \"Visitors to Canada.\" The Non-Resident Firearm Declaration and the Temporary Firearms Borrowing License applications may also be obtained from this web site.\nCanada has three classes of firearms: non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited. Non-restricted firearms include most ordinary hunting rifles and shotguns. These may be brought temporarily into Canada for sporting or hunting use during hunting season, for use in competitions, for in-transit movement through Canada, or for personal protection against wildlife in remote areas of Canada. Anyone wishing to bring hunting rifles into Canada must be at least 18 years old, and the firearm must be properly stored for transport. Restricted firearms are primarily handguns; however, pepper spray and mace are also included in this category. A restricted firearm may be brought into Canada, but an Authorization to Transport permit must be obtained in advance from a Provincial or Territorial Chief Firearms Officer. Prohibited firearms include fully automatic, converted automatics, and assault-type weapons. Prohibited firearms are not allowed into Canada.\nIn advance of any travel, please contact a Canadian embassy or consulate, or the Canadian Firearms Centre (http://www.cfc.ccaf.gc.ca) for detailed information and instructions on temporarily importing firearms. In all cases, travelers must declare to Canadian Customs authorities any firearms and weapons in their possession when entering Canada. If a traveler is denied permission to bring in the firearm, there are often facilities near border crossings where firearms may be stored, pending the traveler's return to the United States. Canadian law requires that officials confiscate firearms and weapons from those crossing the border who deny having them in their possession. Confiscated firearms and weapons are never returned.\nCurrency, Banking, and Weights and Measures\nCanada covers seven time zones. The time in Newfoundland is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) minus three-and-a-half. The time in Halifax is GMT minus four. The time in Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City, Hamilton, London, and Windsor is GMT minus five (Eastern Time in the U.S.). The time in Winnipeg and Regina is GMT minus six (Central Time in the U.S.). The time in Calgary and Edmonton is GMT minus seven (Mountain Time in the U.S.).

Canada has historically been a society of immigrants and of regions. First, the Aboriginal, or native people, arrived from Asia about ten thousand years ago. They organized into complex national groups with their own distinct cultures, economic bases, and languages. Norsemen explored but did not settle Canada in the years before 1500. French explorers and colonists arrived in the early seventeenth century and continued to settle throughout the first half of the next. The British began arriving in the early eighteenth century. After skirmishes and a decisive battle between the French and British armies in 1763, the British came to dominate the part of North America that is today Canada. In 1867 Confederation—Canada's founding event—set the groundwork for provincial differentiation (Quebec versus the rest), two official languages (French and English), two privileged religions (Protestantism and Catholicism), and what became known in the late twentieth century as \"multiculturalism.\"\nVaried timetables of immigration, economic opportunities, and demographic mixes caused Canada's regions to develop differently from one another. Their lack of similarity was largely due to Canada's enormous size, disparate economic development, and the distances between communities. Unequal educational opportunities and social mobility maintained the ethnic and class distinctions that made Canada what the sociologist John Porter came to call a \"vertical mosaic.\"\nToday, with more postsecondary education, travel, and mass communication, these ethnic and regional variations have begun to shrink. In this entry we will emphasize similarities and general tendencies. The theme of diversity remains important, though, as it is essential to understanding Canadian family life.\nDefining Families\nCanadians generally derive a great deal of pleasure from their families. In a 1994 Angus Reid opinion poll, two-thirds of Canadians strongly agreed with the statement that their families are \"the greatest joy in their lives.\" Yet the meaning of family varies from one person to the next. Statistics Canada, the branch of the Canadian government responsible for collecting and analyzing national data, defines the family as\na now-married couple (with or without never-married sons and/or daughters of either or both spouses), a couple living common-law (with or without never-married sons and/or daughters of either or both partners), or a lone parent of any marital status, with at least one never-married son or daughter living in the same dwelling. (Statistics Canada, 1999, p. 119)\nThey call this family form the census family and it is the basic unit upon which the agency collects its family data. Unless otherwise noted, the statistics discussed throughout this article will refer to this family arrangement.\nAlthough a majority of Canadians live in census families—83 percent in 1996—a significant proportion do not (Gee 2000). In 1996 just under a quarter (24.1%) of households were made up of a single person, and 4 percent consisted of people who were either unrelated, or related but did not meet the census definition of a family. The agency also overlooks relations of affection and support that occur outside the immediate household (e.g. relations between absent parents and their children, and between elderly parents living independently from their adult children). Thus, the fairly narrow definition held by Statistics Canada fails to portray accurately the variety of Canadian family and household forms.\nTrends in Marriage\nMore than one hundred years ago, settlers from northern and western Europe brought norms that dictated that young people establish independent homes upon marriage (Gee 1982). As a result, many people did not marry, or they married late in life because they did not have the financial resources to support a household. In 1921 the average age of marriage for men was twenty-eight years and for women it was just under twenty-five. In some ethnic groups—for example, those descended from Highland Scots—the average age of marriage was even higher.\nHistorically, marriage rates in Canada have fluctuated with the state of the country's economy. In the 1930s, while Canada experienced the Great Depression, many couples refrained from marrying due to economic uncertainty and high unemployment. Marriage rates decreased from 7.5 marriages per 1,000 people in 1928 to 5.9 in 1932 (Milan 2000). It was not until World War II that Canadians began to marry again in large numbers. New employment opportunities stimulated the increased rate of matrimony, as did the possibility of conscription. Single men were being called to wartime service, and many couples tried to prevent this through marriage. As a result, in 1942 there were almost eleven marriages per 1,000 people—nearly twice the marriage rate of a decade earlier. The rate declined while the men were at war, but it returned to its 1942 level when couples were reunited in 1946.\nBy the late 1940s marriage rates began to drop again and continued to decline until the 1970s, when children of the postwar marriages, called the baby boom generation, were themselves ready to marry. However, in the 1980s marriage rates returned to a downward trend, and in 1998 they reached an unprecedented low of five marriages per 1,000 people. Fewer Canadians were choosing to marry than ever before, although the economy was not a major influence in this decline.\nTypically, nations with low marriage rates are late marrying populations, so along with the fluctuations in the incidence of marriage rates came a variation in the average age of first marriage. During the early twentieth century, couples married late in life. This changed in the years following World War II, as marriage rates increased and the average age at first marriage declined steadily. By 1962 the average age had dropped to 25.2 years for men and 22.5 for women. The increased affluence following World War II contributed to lowering the age at first marriage because couples could then afford to marry earlier.\nSince the late 1960s, the age at first marriage has risen again. In 1997, for example, first-time brides were, on average, 27.4 years old and grooms were 29.5 year old (The Vanier Institute 2000). This increase has been associated with, among other factors, greater acceptance of cohabitation without marriage, as well as more education and economic independence for women. So paradoxically, though current figures are similar to those earlier in the century, the reasons behind them are quite different.\nCohabitation versus Marriage\nMost Canadian families, 74 percent, were based in married couple unions in 1996. However, membership in this group had declined since 1986, when 80 percent of all couples were legally married. The decreased rate of marriage has been associated with a corresponding increase in common-law unions. Statistics Canada defines a common-law couple as \"two persons of opposite sex who are not legally married to each other, but live together as husband and wife in the same dwelling.\" Although historically Canadians frowned on couples who lived together before marriage, more recently the stigma against nonmarital cohabitation has diminished, if not disappeared. By the end of the millennium, the common-law union was the fastest-growing family category. In 1996 one in seven couples in Canada was living common law, compared with one in nine in 1991. Nonmarital cohabitation was most prevalent in the province of Quebec, where one in four couples live common-law and 43 percent of all such relationships in Canada occurred (Bélanger et al. 2001).\nFor some Canadians, nonmarital cohabitation is a temporary state that precedes a legal marriage, but for others it is a permanent substitute for marriage. There are important differences between legal marriage and cohabitation, despite their perceived interchangeability in some quarters (Baker 2001). Canadian society provides less protection for the property rights of partners in common-law relationships than those of legally married partners. Common-law relationships are typically shorter, produce fewer children, and have a greater tendency towards spousal abuse. They are also particularly vulnerable to changes in economic circumstances (Wu and Pollard 2000). Finally, cohabiting relationships and post-cohabiting marriages are at greater risk of dissolution than are marriages not preceded by cohabitation. The last factor is likely due to what researchers call adverse selectivity. That is, these relationships attract people who are more willing to dissolve unsatisfactory relationships, rather than remain in them unhappily.\nHowever, marriage is not necessarily better than cohabitation. Once other factors (including adverse selectivity) are controlled, physical and mental health differences between cohabiters and the currently married disappear, and both categories are better off than the divorced, separated, and single/never married.\nDivorce\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, divorce was rare in Canada. In 1900 a mere eleven divorces were registered. People widely disapproved of divorce, and the law restricted it. Until 1968, adultery was the only grounds for divorce. Families did dissolve during this period: Some spouses canceled their spousal and parental responsibilities by simply abandoning their families. However, they remained married under law, and this prevented remarriage and the legal establishment of a new family.\nThe introduction of the Divorce Act in 1968 led to a massive change in family behaviors. This law allowed judges to grant divorces on the grounds of \"marriage-breakdown,\" after a couple had been separated for at least three years. Between 1968 and 1970, the number of divorces nearly doubled. A subsequent amendment to the Divorce Act in 1986 reduced the minimum period of separation to one year. Again, this modification resulted in a huge increase in divorce, with the number peaking at 90,900 divorces in 1987 (Oderkirk 1994).\nBetween 1965 and 1988, Canada's divorce rate went from being one of the lowest among industrialized nations to being one of the highest, surpassing even the divorce rates in progressive countries such as France and Sweden. In 1991, once divorce rates had leveled off, there were still 2.8 divorces per 1,000 people in Canada, compared with 1.9 in France and 2.5 in Sweden (in 1992). However, the American divorce rate surpassed that of Canada. In 1992 there were 4.8 divorces per 1,000 people in the United States—nearly twice the Canadian rate (Dumas 1994).\nVariations on the Dominant Pattern\nImmigrant families. In the years following Confederation, wave upon wave of immigrants arrived in Canada, often \"imported\" into particular regions to carry out specific economic tasks: from China to construct the railroad, from Eastern Europe to settle the prairie wheatlands, from Southern Europe to build the central cities. Yet government legislation at the time effectively prevented the development of certain ethnic communities, especially among Asian and black immigrants (Das Gupta 2000). For instance, in the early twentieth century, Chinese immigrants had to pay a \"head tax\" to gain entrance to Canada. Since most men could not afford to bring their wife and children into the country, this law systematically prevented the creation of Chinese Canadian families.\nBefore the mid-twentieth century, Canadian immigration policy favored European settlement in hopes of maintaining a predominantly Anglo-Saxon society (Richard 1991). Immigration from non-European countries was severely restricted. This changed as popular opinion in the early 1960s turned against restrictions on nonwhite immigration. In 1968 a new immigration policy was set up that based admission eligibility not on ethnicity or race, but on broader criteria such as education and training, skills, personal attributes (such as adaptability, motivation, and initiative), demand for the applicant's occupation in Canada, arranged employment, and knowledge of English or French. In the decades that followed, the numbers of British and American immigrants to Canada decreased, and immigration from Asian countries increased substantially.\nMany immigrants came from cultures in which men subordinate women, and their elders subordinate young people. Migration creates profound changes in the relationship between men and women, as well as between generations; it disrupts traditional expectations and supports the possibility of individuation (Shahidian 1999).\nWomen's experience of cultural displacement through immigration may be more positive than that of men because women may be less inclined to resist the women-friendlier dominant culture. For example, more Iranian men retained the socially conservative nature of their patriarchal home culture after immigration than did Iranian women, and they also experienced more problems in adjusting to Western social and economic trends, and to changes in gender roles that augment women's notions of self and female sexuality (Moghissi and Goodman 1999). On the other hand, institutional racism may counterbalance women's positive experiences (Moghissi 1999).\nMigration can lead to generational conflict as young people attempt to embrace North American society (Tirone and Pedlar 2000). Young immigrants, or the children of immigrants, may have problems adjusting to school life, have strained family relationships, and experience issues of ethnic identity and minority status. Often community organizations help young people—especially women—develop an awareness of their condition, a new identity, and a measure of control over their lives (Ralston 1998).\nIn the new cultural environment, families become more nuclear, with the result that extended families loosen their grip, and a cultural distance builds up between members of the diaspora and members of the homeland (Chan and Dorais 1998). Some communities, such as the Asian Indians in Toronto, modify traditional patterns of arranged marriage to give the young more freedom while at the same time enforcing traditional group expectations.\nThe post-1960s amendments to the Immigration Act have led to greater ethnic diversity in Canada, especially among nonwhite groups. While one might expect this to have increased inmarriage (or endogamy) among newly enlarged minority groups, paradoxically, the opposite has occurred. The postwar \"merit-point system\" created a stream of affluent and highly educated new entrants. People with higher levels of education are more exogamous: that is, they show a greater tendency to marry outside their group (Richard 1991). It is therefore not surprising that ethnic exogamy has been increasing.\nHowever, Canadians have always practiced ethnic intermarriage, and this trend has been on the rise since the time of Confederation. In 1991 Canada-born husbands and wives were more exogamous than their foreign-born counterparts, and higher proportions of males married out of their ethnic group than females. Groups who have had high rates of immigration—such as Asian Indians and Chinese—showed the lowest rates of exogamy. Canadians of French and English descent also have low levels of ethnic out-marriage, probably because their large numbers in the Canadian population make it easier to find a spouse of the same ethnic group. Overall, members of the British and French \"charter groups\" are a popular choice of mate. Both men and women tend to marry members of these groups, if they do not marry people of their own ethnic background (Kalbach 2000).\nSame-sex unions. Although fewer social barriers prevent marriage between people of different ethnic groups, the same is not true for same-sex partners. Although Canadians are more liberal in their views on homosexuality than Americans or Mexicans (Tepperman and Curtis 2002)—religious ideas continue to fuel discrimination against homosexuals and their right to form families. In Canada, as in most nations, gays and lesbians are unable to legally marry because marriage continues to be defined as a union between a man and a woman. Gays and lesbians are often portrayed as being outside of and excluded from family social relations. In reality, many are deeply embedded in familial structures as partners, parents, children, siblings, aunts, uncles, and grandchildren.\nAt the start of the twenty-first century, same-sex couples had gained some of the recognition and benefits automatically granted to heterosexual couples. In February 1998 the province of British Columbia became the first jurisdiction in North America to redefine the term \"spouse\" in its Family Relations Act to include same-sex couples. The amendment gave gay and lesbian partners the same privileges and obligations held by those in heterosexual unions, including: custody of children, access, and child support (O'Brian and Goldberg 2000). In 1999 and 2000 Quebec, Ontario, and the federal government adopted omnibus bills granting same-sex common-law spouses almost all the same rights as heterosexual couples under the tax system, social security programs, and family law (Rose 2000). Additionally, in 2001 Statistics Canada included questions about same-sex unions for the first time in the national census.\nThese changes showed the growing acceptance of gay and lesbian couples in Canadian society. Public opinion polls confirmed that Canadians are becoming more accepting of same-sex unions. In a 2001 Leger Marketing poll, 65.4 percent of those surveyed agreed that Canada should grant same-sex couples the right to legally marry and 75.7 percent felt that Canada should give homosexuals the same rights as heterosexuals.\nHowever, these tolerant attitudes do not extend to the issue of childcare. For example, only 53.1 percent of those surveyed agreed that Canada should permit homosexuals to adopt children. This disapproval of adoption by gays and lesbians likely reflects the belief that homosexual parenting will have a harmful influence on the child's sexual development. By contrast, research on the topic shows that children raised by gays and lesbians exhibit neither a greater tendency toward homosexuality nor significant differences in gender identity or gender behaviors than children raised by heterosexual parents (O'Brien and Goldberg 2000).\nFamilies with Children\nThe addition of a child has an enormous impact on any family. Family dynamics and relations are often altered to accommodate the new member. Typically, a woman's dependence on her partner's earnings, and thereby her vulnerability within the family, increases with the presence of young children and relative to the number of children. This pattern is similar—indeed, deeply entrenched— across Western industrial countries, and continues even in the face of active social policies to minimize their effects (Bianchi, Casper, and Peltola 1999). From this standpoint, fertility and fertility decline play important roles in changing gender relations and family life, in Canada and elsewhere.\nFertility Decline\nThe average size of the Canadian family has dropped since the 1970s. In 1971 families had an average of 3.7 persons; since 1986, the average has remained constant at 3.1 persons. Contemporary Canadian families are similar in size to those in the United States, where an average of 3.2 persons made up the American family in 2000 (Fields and Casper 2000). These small family sizes are mainly a result of lower fertility and reduced childbearing, as showed by lower birth rates.\nIn fact, birth rates have been dropping in most industrialized countries since the latter part of the nineteenth century. These rates have fluctuated slightly over that period. For instance, after World War II (roughly 1946–1966), both Canada and the United States experienced high birth rates in what people refer to as the postwar baby boom. During this boom, the total fertility rate (TFR)—the average number of children a woman is likely to bear in her lifetime—peaked at 3.94 children in 1959, and actual birth rates peaked in 1957 (Péron et al. 1999).\nThe Canadian TFR dropped dramatically from its height in the 1960s, and fertility remained fairly stable through the mid-1970s to the end of the millennium. After 1976, the rate fluctuated between 1.8 and 1.6, although 1998 saw a slight drop in TFR to 1.55 births (Bélanger et al. 2001). These rates have varied across the country, illustrating Canada's regional and ethnic diversity. In 1998 Newfoundland had the lowest fertility rate in Canada, at 1.2 births per woman. In the same year Nunavut, a region with a high proportion of Aboriginal peoples, had a fertility rate of three births per woman.\nCanadian women give birth to more children than do women in many European countries. This is largely because of high rates of immigration from high-fertility countries. Still, the Canadian fertility rate is below that of the United States, where in 1997 American women were estimated to bear\n2.06 children in their lifetimes (Bélanger 1999).\nNot only are Canadian couples having fewer children than in the past; they are also having children later in life. Many Canadian women now wait until they are in their late twenties or early thirties before having their first child. The mother's age at childbirth, which varies by region and ethnicity, also varies according to social and economic status. Women who have children early typically have less education and fewer job skills (therefore, lower job possibilities and less income potential). Young mothers are also more likely to be unmarried, so many must deal with the economic difficulties associated with single parenthood.\nSingle-Parent Families\nAmong those Canadian marriages that dissolved in 1995, child custody was a concern in approximately 70 percent of these cases. In more than two-thirds of these divorces, the courts granted mothers sole custody of their offspring. Thus, many women in Canada who experienced divorce also became single parents.\nOf the 1.1 million single parents enumerated in 1996, 58 percent were separated or divorced, 22 percent were single or never married, and 20 percent were widows. The vast majority, 83 percent, were women (The Vanier Institute 2000). This gender difference is significant because female-headed single-parent families are more likely to suffer from lower incomes—indeed, poverty—than male-headed single-parent families. In 1998 single-parent families headed by women made up the largest fraction of all low-income families. Women-headed families were more than twice as likely as male-headed families to be living in poverty (42% versus 17.5%).\nThe number of Canadian single-parent families increased dramatically since the 1970s: almost 250 percent between 1971 and 1996, compared with an overall increase of only 55 percent in the total number of Canadian families. These rates mark a return to proportions seen in the early decades of the twentieth century. In 1931, for example, 13.6 percent of Canadian families were headed by one parent; this is compared to 15 percent in 1996. However, the reasons for single parenthood have changed during this century. Whereas in the first half of the twentieth century, most single-parent households were a result of the death of a spouse, in the second half of the century they were mainly the result of separation, divorce, or nonmarriage (Oderkirk and Lochhead 1992).\nFamilies over the Life Course\nCanada's population is aging. This results from a combination of lowered fertility and general increases in life expectancy among both men and women. In 1999 12.4 percent of the Canadian population was sixty-five years of age or older (Bélanger et al. 2001). By the year 2001, it was projected that this portion will have risen to 14 percent, and with continued declines in fertility, this fraction will continue rising. These are trends common to other Western societies, especially those throughout Europe.\nWith the graying of the population, concerns about the costs of treating an aging population have increased. Recently, there has been a trend to move elder care outside institutional settings, and it has increasingly become the responsibility of informal caregivers, most frequently female family members. Health care services that were previously offered in institutional settings are now being performed in community health centers, day clinics, and people's own homes. This has created a difficult situation for elderly people, especially in rural Canada. Alongside limited formal health care supports in these areas, depopulation, aging communities, smaller family sizes, limited community resources, and volunteer burnout have resulted in fewer informal community supports (Blakley 1999).\nThis, in turn, led to widespread unease that the middle-aged children of elderly parents will be squeezed or sandwiched by the multiple roles and obligations associated with dependent children, elderly parents, and work obligations (McDaniel 2001). Elder care involvement can significantly reduce the amount of time available for other family relationships, as well as for work and leisure; yet research has shown that, so far, this has not occurred among the vast majority of middle-aged Canadians. Few Canadians provide frequent help to their elderly parents (Rosenthal et al. 1996). In fact, until parents reach the age of seventy-five, the flow of support favors the children: they receive more help from parents than they give to them.\nThe majority of Canadian seniors continue to live on their own well into advanced age, and most of the care they receive comes not from their children, but from other members of the same generation, usually a spouse. Friends and neighbors may, however, provide essential help when seniors live alone (Martel and Legare 2000).\nEthnicity influences the amount of assistance provided to older relatives. Asians, East Indians, and southern Europeans provide higher levels of help than British respondents; for example Oya koh koh (filial obligation in Japanese) has a significant effect on nisei (second generation) and sansei (third generation) children's provision of emotional support to older parents in British Columbia (Kobayashi 2000). However, structural factors (like living arrangement and age) rather than cultural factors (like filial obligation) are stronger predictors of assistance and involvement (Keefe, Rosenthal, and Beland 2000). Even among nisei and sansei children, financial and service support are more affected by such material conditions as socioeconomic status, child's availability, and parent's health (Kobayashi 2000.)\nConclusion\nThis chapter has provided an illustration of the diversity of Canadian families over time and space. We have seen that government policies sometimes shape Canadian families, and sometimes people form their families despite such policies. Families grow out of past traditions and new perspectives. Relations within and between families will often differ, depending on gender, race, ethnicity, economic situation, and sexual orientation.\nChanges in Canadian families since the mid-1970s include fewer children, more working mothers, more divorces, and more people cohabitating. Exogamy has increased even among traditional endogamous people such as Jewish Canadians. In many respects, Canadian families are similar to families in other Western societies, such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Households have shrunk throughout the West. Marriages are expressive and companionate, and though they may have an instrumental component, they are not formed for instrumental reasons alone. Women will often leave marriages that do not provide what they require. Family members, generally, are mobile and often distant. Overall, people's lives are more individualized: more fluid, varied, and idiosyncratic (see Jones, Marsden, and Tepperman 1992).\nEnormous diversity has always characterized families in Canada, although the nature of this diversity has changed over the years. Canada has historically been a society of immigrants and a society of regions. The new immigration policy has increased the ethnic mélange of the Canadian population and in so doing dramatically shifted the variety of Canadian families. It also increased exogamy and mixing, leading to the creation of new, blended cultures, in an already multicultural population.\nRoman Catholic 47%, Protestant 36%, Eastern Orthodox 1%, Jewish 1%, Muslim 1%, Hindu, Buddhist\ncurrency:\nCanadian dollar = 100 cents\nFederation in n North America . Canada, the world's second largest country (after Russia ), is thinly populated. Much of the land is too cold or mountainous for human settlement, and most Canadians live within 300km (200mi) of the s border with the USA.\nWestern Canada has the most rugged terrain, including the Pacific ranges and the mighty Rocky Mountains . Mount Logan is Canada's highest peak, at 6050m (19,850ft). East of the Rockies are the fertile interior plains of Canada's Prairie Provinces (s Alberta , Manitoba and Saskatchewan ). This vast farming region is the n extension of the prairies of the United States .\nIn the n are the bleak Arctic islands. The Canadian Shield, in e central Canada, is a vast region of ancient rocks, which covers almost half the country, enclosing the Hudson Bay lowlands. South of the Canadian Shield lie Canada's most populous regions: the lowlands n of Lakes Erie and Ontario and the St Lawrence river valley, including the capital, Ottawa , and Toronto . The northernmost part of the Appalachians are in the se.\nClimate\nCanada has a cold climate, with winter temperatures below freezing throughout most of the country. In the n, along the Arctic Circle, temperatures are below freezing for seven months every year. But Vancouver on the w coast has a mild climate, and average temperatures remain above freezing in winter.\nWestern Canada has plenty of rainfall but the prairies are dry with 250–500mm (10–20in) of rain annually. South-east Canada has a moist climate and Montréal has an annual average of c.1040mm (41in) of rain.\nVegetation\nForests of cedar and hemlock grow on the western mountains, with firs and spruces higher up. The interior plains were once grassy prairies, but today they are used mainly for farming and ranching. The far n is tundra. The se lowlands contain forests of deciduous trees, such as beech, oak and walnut. The Appalachians include beautiful mixed coniferous and deciduous forests.\nHistory\nCanada's first people, ancestors of present-day Native Americans , arrived from Asia c.40,000 years ago. Later arrivals were the Inuit , also from Asia.  John Cabot was the first European to reach the Canadian coast in 1497. A race began between France and Britain for the riches in this new land. France gained an initial advantage when  Jacques Cartier discovered the St Lawrence River in 1534 and claimed Canada for France.\nThe French established the first European settlement in 1605 and founded Québec in 1608. The empire was extended by explorers such as La Salle . French settlement in the w was generally much slower than English development on the Atlantic coast. The French and Indian Wars (1689–1763) were a protracted battle for colonial domination of Canada. In 1713, the province of Nova Scotia was ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht . In 1759, Québec was captured by Britain, and France surrendered all of its Canadian lands in the Treaty of Paris (1763). In 1774 the French-Canadian population of Québec gained territory to the Ohio River, the Continental Congress responded by invading Canada. During the American Revolution , Canada remained loyal to the English crown, and American attempts to capture it failed. In 1784, the province of New Brunswick was created out of Nova Scotia . The Constitutional Act (1791) divided Canada along linguistic and religious lines: Upper Canada (now Ontario ) was English and Protestant; Lower Canada (now Québec) was French and Catholic.\nExplorers such as  Alexander Mackenzie ,  James Cook and  George  Vancouver enabled Britain to form the crown colony of British Columbia in 1858. Border disputes with the USA (see Aroostook War , War of 1812 ) continued into the 19th century.\nLarge-scale immigration from Ireland and Scotland increased tension and conflict between the English-speaking majority and the French-speaking minority. In an attempt to reduce conflict, the British passed the British North America Act (1867). This constitutional act established the federation or Dominion of Canada, consisting of Quebec , Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. In 1869 it acquired the lands of the Hudson's Bay Company and other provinces were added: Manitoba (1870), British Columbia (1871), Prince Edward Island (1873), Alberta and Saskatchewan (1905) and Newfoundland (1949). The Dominion's first prime minister,  Sir  John  A. Macdonald , established the Canadian Pacific Railway, which proved disastrous to his career but provided the means for 3 million Europeans to emigrate to Canada between 1894 and 1914. Canadians fought as part of Allied forces in both World Wars, and in 1949 Canada was a founding member of NATO . Under the leadership of  W. L.  Mackenzie King , national unity was strengthened and industry developed. In 1963,  Lester Pearson became prime minister and, as a sign of Canada's growing national confidence, adopted a new national flag. In 1967, Montréal hosted the influential Expo' 67.  Pierre Trudeau's first administration (1968–79) faced violent separatist demands for Québec's independence, and martial law was imposed in 1970. In 1976, Montréal hosted the summer Olympic Games . In Trudeau's second administration (1980–84), Québec voted to remain part of the federation (1980). The Canada Act (1981) amended the constitution, and Canada became a fully sovereign state with a Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It was approved by all the provinces, except Québec which claimed power of constitutional veto. In 1985  Brian Mulroney and provincial leaders signed the Meech Lake Accord, which provided for Québec to be brought into the constitutional settlement as a “distinct society”. Manitoba and Newfoundland failed to endorse the Accord, and Canada was plunged into constitutional crisis.\nPolitics\nJean Chrétien became prime minister in 1993, and was re-elected in 1997 and 2000. A 1995 referendum on sovereignty for Québec was narrowly defeated by 50.6% to 49.4%. Regional differences exist, and experts argue that the reconciliation of the divisions between the e (Montréal- Toronto ) axis and the w (Vancouver- Winnipeg ) axis is vital for Canada's future prosperity. In 2003, Paul Martin became prime minister.\nCanada's new constitution enabled Native Americans to press for land claims. In 1999 part of the Northwest Territories became the Inuit territory of Nunavut .\nEconomy\nCanada is a highly developed and prosperous nation (2000 GDP per capita, US$24,800). Although farmland covers only 8% of the land, farms are highly mechanized and productive. Canada is the world's leading producer of linseed and the second largest producer of oats and rapeseed. Canada's vast conifer forests and the availability of cheap hydroelectric power has encouraged the development of huge wood pulp and paper industries. Fishing is important in both Atlantic and Pacific waters.\nCanada is rich in mineral resources and is the world's leading producer of uranium, potash, and zinc ore. Other major resources include nickel, aluminium, cobalt ore and natural gas. Lesser resources include copper, gold, molybdenum and salt. Canada is also a major producer of petroleum. Manufacturing is highly developed, especially in the cities where 77% of the population live. Canada is a major manufacturer of commercial vehicles. Other products include chemicals, electronic goods, machinery and telecommunications equipment.\nCanada has long been influenced, both culturally and economically, by the USA, and the two countries have the largest bilateral trade flow in the world. Since January 1, 1994, Canada, Mexico and the USA have been linked through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the world's largest trading area, with the aim to eliminate cross-border tariffs within 20 years.\nPolitical map\nThe Oxford Companion to British History\n© The Oxford Companion to British History 2002, originally published by Oxford University Press 2002.\nCanada . A self-governing dominion since 1867, much of Canada was earlier colonized by the British and the French. British interest in the area initially focused not on the land but on the sea. Ships leaving the west country probably located the Grand Banks fisheries even before  John Cabot's explorations of 1497. Despite official discouragement of settlement, Newfoundland became de facto the first overseas British colony, a status it relinquished later than other parts of what would become Canada.\nIn 17th- and 18th-cent. usage, the name Canada referred primarily to the St Lawrence lowlands. Here the British involvement is usually dated from Wolfe's victory on the Plains of Abraham (1759), but this was not the first British attempt to capture the French colony. In 1629 the Kirke brothers seized the small fort at Quebec . The colony was returned to the French three years later. Subsequent large-scale but unsuccessful attacks took place in 1690 and 1711.\nFrom 1670, through the royally chartered Hudson's Bay Company , England claimed sovereignty over Rupert's Land, an area including much of the central plains and northern Canada. The control the Hudson's Bay Company exercised was largely at the sufferance of the native peoples of the area, but the expanding fur trade eventually led the company to set up posts in the far north and on the west coast, establishing British claims to this contested region.\nIn the long-running 18th-cent. conflict with France , the British definitively acquired Acadia , renamed Nova Scotia , in 1713. For some forty years, the British laid few claims to the area. Unable to secure a pledge of allegiance from the Acadian population, British authorities dispossessed and deported them. Nova Scotia was then available for Anglo-American settlement.\nWith the fall of Quebec in 1759, and the 1763 treaty of Paris , British control over the northern half of North America was unrivalled. The attempt to integrate the French, catholic population of the St Lawrence valley into the British empire formed a large part of the political agenda for the next century. A series of constitutions was enacted to address the evolving relationship. The Quebec Act (1774) guaranteed religious freedoms and legal customs, providing greater privileges to the Canadians than catholics enjoyed in Britain . In doing so, it heightened tensions between Britain and its colonies to the south.\nWhen conflict between Britain and its other North American colonies broke out, Nova Scotia, though populated in large part by recent arrivals from Massachusetts, obeyed the military garrison at Halifax. Quebec maintained its allegiance, not necessarily out of love for the British rulers, but for fear of the more radical protestants of the rebel colonies. In the aftermath of the American Revolution , loyalist refugees streamed north to the colonies that had refused to join the rebels.\nThe arrival of the Anglo-American refugees created new exigencies. Nova Scotia was divided into two colonies, New Brunswick and peninsular Nova Scotia. Prince Edward Island had already acquired a separate administration from Nova Scotia in 1769, and Cape Breton Island enjoyed a separate status as a refuge for loyalists for 40 years. In 1791, Quebec was divided essentially along the Ottawa river to create Upper and Lower Canada. Henceforth, Upper Canada contained primarily an English-speaking population.\nThe North American colonies were often more of strategic than economic importance to the British. With the fisheries secured, the colonies served two other main purposes. They provided other primary resources, such as wheat, timber, and minerals. Also, they offered a place for British emigrants. Until the 1810s, relatively few made the rough transatlantic voyage to settle in the British North American colonies. But after 1815, Highland Scots and northern Irish flocked to Canada. These huge influxes of population exacerbated tensions between colonial politicians and the mother country and were important factors in the rebellions of 1837–8 in Lower Canada. In turn, these rebellions suggested to the British government that the attempt to integrate the French-Canadian population into the empire had not been successful.\nA third constitution, the Union Act, tried to address the problems, uniting the two Canadas, in the hope of swamping the French-speaking population. However, brilliant French-Canadian politicians made alliances with reformist English-speaking colleagues to defeat the attempts. The fourth constitution, the British North America Act of 1867, essentially rejected the assimilationist policy, by separating again Upper and Lower Canada, and joining them with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, much to the dismay of many people in the latter two colonies. The four provinces received important degrees of autonomy, within a federal system. This constitution, the longest lasting of all the attempts, has proved the most malleable, and despite increasing tensions since the 1960s, the most successful. But Quebec separatism, as demonstrated by the referendum of 1995, remains strong.\nWith the BNA Act, the name Canada extended to take in the provinces involved. Other provinces and territories were either annexed or joined the federation subsequently: the Northwest Territories through purchase from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1870; Manitoba (1870); British Columbia (1871); Prince Edward Island (1873); the Arctic Islands (1880), Yukon (1898); Alberta and Saskatchewan (1905); Newfoundland (1949). Canada was a self-governing dominion, the ‘eldest daughter’ of the empire. Constitutionally equal in status to Britain according to the statute of Westminster (1931), until 1949 the final court of appeal remained the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, and until 1982 any amendments to the constitution had to be requested of the Westminster Parliament.\nDue to further waves of migration, Canada retained and extended its British character. Between 1902 and 1912 alone, over 1.5 million British emigrants left for Canada. A similarly large proportion of immigrants arrived following the Second World War . In part because of these continuing migrations, cultural and emotional links to Britain in English-speaking Canada remained strong until relatively recently and Canada contributed greatly to the allied war effort in both world wars. However, following the Second World War, Canadian politicians and diplomats have attempted to carve out a separate space in world affairs. For instance,  Lester  B.  Pearson won the Nobel peace prize for negotiating an end to the Suez crisis in 1956 despite British consternation at Canada's role in the matter.\nBy 1994 Canada's population was nearing 30 million. Economically, Canada has at times relied heavily on British markets and investment. Though in slow decline for a long period, since the Second World War trade between Canada and Britain has levelled out at a lower, but not inconsequential, level. As the economic clout of the USA expanded in the 20th cent., so did its influence over Canada. The passage of the Free Trade Agreement in 1989 (and later the North American Free Trade Agreement) recognized and indeed enhanced Canada's continental orientation.\nColin  M.  Coates\nCOPYRIGHT 2004 The Gale Group Inc.\nEnvironment Canada\nCanada 's Department of the Environment, commonly known as Environment Canada, was founded in 1971. It was created to bring the different aspects of Canadian environmental policy, which had until then been split between several different departments, under the control of one main body. Environment Canada has primary, but not exclusive, control of implementing Canada's environmental policies (the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, for instance, still has control of fisheries protection).\nEnvironment Canada has three main areas of responsibility:\nWeather and environmental prediction—collecting environmental data and forecasting weather, as well as researching climate change and other human environmental impacts\nClean environment—developing pollution standards and controlling the use of toxic substances\nNature—conserving biological diversity, primarily through parks and the protection of endangered species\nEnvironment Canada also has responsibility for upholding Canada's end of international agreements, and working with the environmental agencies of other nations on issues of regional or global importance. The Commission for Environmental Cooperation, for example, is an organization established by the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States to address regional environmental concerns, help prevent potential trade and environmental conflicts, and promote the effective enforcement of environmental law.\nIn contrast to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has complete control over the implementation of American environmental legislation, Environmental Canada shares its responsibilities with the provincial governments. However, the distinction between what falls under federal authority and what belongs to the provinces is rarely clear, especially when it comes to environmental protection.\nIn an effort to minimize overlap, the Canadian federal government typically limits its involvement in environmental protection to a few key areas where its constitutional authority is clear and undisputed. Those areas include national parks, aboriginal title lands, inland and offshore fisheries, and issues of \"national concern,\" such as toxic substances and endangered species, and are the focus of Environment Canada's authority. Otherwise, environmental protection responsibilities such as assessments, inspections, and enforcement generally fall to the provinces.\nsee also  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nInternet Resource"

This network became the lifeline of New York  City and the harbor area. The heart of this transportation network was the  Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal (CRRNJ), located in the northern portion  of the park. The CRRNJ Terminal stands with the Statue of Liberty and Ellis  Island to unfold one of this nation's most dramatic stories: the immigration of  northern, southern, and eastern Europeans into the United States. After being  greeted by the Statue of Liberty and processed at Ellis Island, these immigrants  purchased tickets and boarded trains, at the CRRNJ Terminal, that took them to  their new homes throughout the United States. The Terminal served these  immigrants as the gateway to the realization of their hopes and dreams of a new  life in America.\nToday, Liberty State Park continues to serve a vital role in the New York  Harbor area. As the railroads and industry declined, the land was abandoned and  became a desolate dump site. With the development of Liberty State Park came a  renaissance of the waterfront. Land with decaying buildings, overgrown tracks  and piles of debris was transformed into a modern urban state park. The park was  formerly opened on Flag Day, June 14, 1976, as New Jersey's bicentennial gift to  the nation. Most of this 1,122 acre park is open space with approximately 300  acres developed for public recreation."

The poem did not receive much recognition and was quite forgotten after the auction.\nIn the early 1900s and after Lazarus’ death, one of her friends began a campaign to memorialize Lazarus and her New Colossus sonnet. The effort was a success, and a plaque with the poem’s text was mounted inside the pedestal of the statute.\nStatue of Liberty Poem\nAlso known as the Statue of Liberty poem, New Colossus and its famous last lines have become part of American history.

She holds this torch high in the daytime and during the night as well. She shines her light in the midst of darkness.\nThis symbol of freedom and hope  was presented  by the people of France to the people of the United States in 1886 in honor of the friendship between the two nations.  Yet,  the Statue belongs to all people.  Her message is universal, speaking  to the hearts of those who cherish freedom  everywhere.\nLiberty's image is one of strength, majesty, and hope,  visible in her eternally raised right arm which carries the torch of freedom.  Holding aloft a light that never fails, she represents hope to the hopeless, welcome to the poor, courage to the meek. Facing outward toward the ocean, her lamp is a beacon on stormy seas, drawing to her shores, those from afar who seek a better  life.  For these, and for countless others who embrace her message, the Statue of Liberty  represents  the Golden Door.\nWhat is the Golden Door? \nIt is the entrance into liberty and freedom from oppression that is the promise of America - a land, a people, a way of life.\nIt is also the   freedom of spirit and of choice that was declared  an inalienable right in the Declaration of Independence - a document whose  date of execution, July 4th, 1776, is inscribed on the tablet she carries. The Statue welcomes all to this door  - the lost, the needy, the rejected, the exiled.  She invites them to step through it into freedom.\nLiberty's comforting presence is increasingly needed when the sea of world events becomes more stormy, the waves higher. In times of turbulence, her light is reassuring, her presence, a guarantor of safety.\nImmortalized in the poem of Emma Lazarus, the Statue speaks eternally the words of compassion: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\" These words from the \"The New Colossus,\" written in 1883, appear on the Statue's pedestal.\n\"Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,\nWith conquering limbs astride from land to land;\nHere at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand\nA mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\nIs the imprisoned lightning, and her name,\nMother of Exiles.

Before Lazarus, the only Jewish poets published in the United States were humor and hymnal writers. Her book Songs of a Semite was the first collection of poetry to explore Jewish-American identity while struggling with the problems of modern poetics.\nHer family was wealthy, and Lazarus was educated at home, acquiring a knowledge of Greek and Latin classics, as well as the modern literature of Germany, Italy, and France. Lazarus developed an affinity for verse at an early age. As a teenager, she began translating the poems of Victor Hugo, Heinrich Heine, Alexandre Dumas, and Friedrich Schiller.\nLazarus began publishing poems in the 1860s and 1870s, including translations of German poems. In 1866, her father arranged for the poems and translations she wrote between the ages of fourteen and sixteen to be privately printed, and the following year a commercially published volume titled Poems and Translations followed. The work attracted the attention of poets and critics, including Ralph Waldo Emerson , who became her friend and mentor.\nLazarus published another volume of poetry, Admetus and Other Poems (1871); a novel, Alide: An Episode in Goethe's Life (1874); and a verse drama, The Spagnoletto (1876), before her interests in Jewish identity and culture were reflected in her work. After reading George Eliot's 1876 novel Daniel Deronda, which explores Jewish ancestory in Victorian society, Lazarus began to translate medieval Hebrew poetry from the German. News of the Russian pogroms fueled her interest. In 1881, she witnessed firsthand the tumultuous arrival of exiled refugees into the United States. The following year, she published a polemic in The Century, as well as another collection of verse, Songs of a Semite: The Dance to Death and Other Poems.\nFollowing the publication of Songs of a Semite, Lazarus wrote several prose pieces concerned with the historical and political interests of the Jewish people, and travelled to France and England, where she met and befriended literary figures, such as Robert Browning and William Morris.\nAfter returning from Europe, Lazarus was asked for an original poem to be auctioned off as a fundraiser for the building of the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. Though she initially declined, Lazarus later used the opportunity to express the plight of refugee immigrants, who she cared greatly about. Her resulting sonnet, \" The New Colossus \", includes the iconic lines \"Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\" and is inscribed on a plaque on the pedestal of the monument.\nIn 1884, Lazarus fell ill, most likely from Hodgkin's lymphoma. After her father's death the following year, she travelled again, hoping an encounter with a new country would help her regain some of her strength. She visited Italy for the first time, followed by England and France, but soon returned to the United States when her illness worsened. She died a few months later on November 17, 1887.\nIn the years following her death, Lazarus fell into relative obscurity. A 1926 edition of her complete collected poems was kept out of the public eye by her sister, who owned the rights to the work, but whose religious and political beliefs were in opposition to the Judaic concerns raised by Lazarus in her poetry."

The statue, designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28, 1886, was a gift to the United States from the people of France. The statue is of a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, who bears a torch and a tabula ansata (a tablet evoking the law) upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence , July 4, 1776. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States: a welcoming signal to immigrants arriving from abroad.\nQuotes[ edit ]\nWe aren't here today to bow before the representation of a fierce warlike god, filled with wrath and vengeance, but we joyously contemplate instead our own deity keeping watch and ward before the open gates of America and greater than all that have been celebrated in ancient song. Instead of grasping in her hand thunderbolts of terror and of death, she holds aloft the light which illumines the way to man's enfranchisement. We will not forget that Liberty has here made her home, nor shall her chosen altar be neglected. Willing votaries will constantly keep alive its fires and these shall gleam upon the shores of our sister Republic thence, and joined with answering rays a stream of light shall pierce the darkness of ignorance and man's oppression, until Liberty enlightens the world.\nGrover Cleveland , Dedication speech for the Statue of Liberty (28 October 1886).\nSince September 11, 2001, I have often thought that perhaps it was fortunate for the world that the attackers targeted the World Trade Center instead of the Statue of Liberty, for if they had destroyed our sacred symbol of democracy I fear we as Americans would have been unable to keep ourselves from indulging in paroxysms of revenge of a sort the world has never seen before. If that had happened, it would have befouled the meaning of the Statue of Liberty beyond any hope of subsequent redemption -- if there were any people left to care. I have learned from my students that this upsetting thought of mine is subject to several unfortunate misconstruals, so let me expand on it to ward them off. The killing of thousands of innocents in the World Trade Center was a heinous crime, much more evil than the destruction of the Statue of Liberty would have been. And, yes, the World Trade Center was a much more appropriate symbol of al Qaeda's wrath than the Statue of Liberty would have been, but for that very reason it didn't mean as much, as a symbol, to us. It was Mammon and Plutocrats and Globalization, not Lady Liberty.\nThou warden of the western gate, above Manhattan Bay,\nThe fogs of doubt that hid thy face are driven clean away:\nThine eyes at last look far and clear, thou liftest high thy hand\nTo spread the light of liberty world-wide for every land.\nHenry van Dyke , Liberty Enlightening the World (1917).\nNot like the brazen giant of Greek fame,\nWith conquering limbs astride from land to land;\nHere at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand\nA mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\nIs the imprisoned lightning, and her name\nMother of Exiles.

A citizens committee invited famous authors to write appropriate words and donate their manuscripts for auction.

The poet lived from 1849-1887. Scroll down to see some of Lazarus' poetry\nHulton Archive/Getty Images\nIn her poem The New Colossus, Emma Lazarus created what stood for years as an American credo. You know the words: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...\"\nThe words of the poem were engraved on a bronze plaque hung in the Statue of Liberty museum 20 years after her death. To many, the verse expressed the governing U.S. attitude toward immigrants: welcome. But today, a new debate over immigration is dominating the political debate.\nSo it's a good time to take a new look at the writer. Esther Schor, poet and professor of English at Princeton University, offers that chance with a new biography: Emma Lazarus.\nLazarus was a Sephardic Jew, a descendant of people expelled from Spain centuries before. She often wrote about the \"Jewish plight\" in her poetry.  She was an early Jewish nationalist — advocating for a Jewish state in Palestine as early as the 1880s.\nNear the end of her life she became an advocate for disenfranchised immigrants, who were arriving by the thousands in the late 1800s.\nShe wrote The New Colossus at age 34. Less than five years later she was dead of cancer, never knowing the impact her poem had on the nation.\nArticle continues after sponsorship\nOctober 21, 200611:16 AM ET\nThree of Emma Lazarus' poems, including her most famous, The New Colossus:\nThe New Colossus\nNot like the brazen giant of Greek fame,\nWith conquering limbs astride from land to land;\nHere at our sea-washed, sunset fates shall stand\nA mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\nIs the imprisoned lightning, and her name\nMother of Exiles.  From her beacon-hand\nGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command\nThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.\n \n\"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!\"  cries she\nWith silent lips.  \"Give me your tired, your poor,\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\nThe wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\nSend these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\nI lift my lamp beside the golden door!\"\nHeroes\nThe scarlet creeper reddens over graves,\nAmong the solemn trees enlooped with vines;\nHeroic spirits haunt the solitudes, —\nThe noble souls of half a million braves,\nAmid the murmurous pines.\nAh! who is left behind,\nEarnest and eloquent, sincere and strong,\nTo consecrate their memories with words\nNot all unmeet?  with fitting dirge and song\nTo chant a requiem purer than the wind,\nAnd sweeter than the birds?\n \nHere, though all seems at peace,\nThe placid, measureless sky serenely fair,\nThe laughter of the breeze among the leaves,\nThe bars of sunlight slanting through the trees,\nThe reckless wild-flowers blooming everywhere,\nThe grasses' delicate sheaves, —\nNathless each breeze that blows,\nEach tree that trembles to its leafy head\nWith nervous life, revives within our mind,\nTender as flowers of May, the thoughts of those\nWho lie beneath the living beauty, dead, —\nBeneath the sunshine, blind.\nFor brave dead soldiers, these:\nBlessings and tears of aching thankfulness,\nSoft flowers for the graves in wreaths enwove,\nThe odorous lilac of dear memories,\nThe heroic blossoms of the wilderness,\nAnd the rich rose of love.\n \nBut who has sung their praise,\nNot less illustrious, who are living yet?\nArmies of heroes, satisfied to pass\nCalmly, serenely from the whole world's gaze,\nAnd cheerfully accept, without regret,\nTheir old life as it was,\n \nWith all its petty pain,\nIts irritating littleness and care;\nThey who have scaled the mountain, with content\nSublime, descend to live upon the plain;\nSteadfast as though they breathed the mountain-air\nStill, wheresoe'er they went.\nThey who were brave to act,\nAnd rich enough their action to forget;\nWho, having filled their day with chivalry,\nWithdraw and keep their simpleness intact,\nAnd all unconscious add more luster yet\nUnto their victory.\nOn the broad Western plains\nTheir patriarchal life they live anew;\nHunters as mighty as the men of old,\nOr harvesting the plenteous, yellow grains,\nGathering ripe vintage of dusk bunches blue,\nOr working mines of gold;\n \nOr toiling in the town,\nArmed against hindrance, weariness, defeat,\nWith dauntless purpose not to swerve or yield,\nAnd calm, defiant strength, they struggle on,\nAs sturdy and as valiant in the street,\nAs in the camp and field.\n \nAnd those condemned to live,\nMaimed, helpless, lingering still through suffering years,\nMay they not envy now the restful sleep\nOf the dear fellow-martyrs they survive?\nNot o'er the dead, but over these, your tears,\nO brothers, ye may weep!\n \nNew England fields I see,\nThe lovely, cultured landscape, waving grain,\nWide, haughty rivers, and pale, English skies.\nAnd lo!

The Australian rapper crowns the Billboard Hot 100 with her debut hit \"Fancy,\" featuring Charli XCX (2-1). As Azalea also rises 3-2 as the featured artist on Ariana Grande's \"Problem,\" Azalea joins the Beatles as the only acts to rank at Nos. 1 and 2 simultaneously with their first two Hot 100 hits.\nAction abounds on this week's Hot 100, including climbs into the top 10 for Nico & Vinz and Jason Derulo, while \"Fancy\" additionally takes over atop the Digital Songs chart, so let's dive into our weekly look at the numbers behind the Hot 100's top 10 and more. \nAzalea adds a chapter to the Hot 100's record book by achieving a feat that the Beatles last earned on the Feb. 22, 1964, chart. That week, the Fab Four's debut pop culture-changing smash \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" held at No. 1 and \"She Loves You\" lifted 3-2. The songs had debuted the weeks of Jan. 18 and 25, 1964, respectively, and soared to the chart's top two spots after the band made its landmark appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" on Feb. 9, 1964.\n(Incredibly, \"Hand\" and \"Loves\" would hold the top two rungs for six weeks, with \"Hand\" on top for four frames before they swapped spots. On April 4, 1964, \"Loves\" fell 1-3 and \"Hand,\" 2-4, so, that week, the Beatles would have to settle for a consolation prize: the group locked up the April 4 list's entire top five , the only time an act has monopolized the region in the Hot 100's 55-year history.) \nIggy Azalea vs Jennifer Lopez: Both Wear Burgundy at 2014 Billboard Music Awards\nFlash-forward 50 years to March 22, 2014, when Azalea's \"Fancy\" bowed at No. 88. On the May 17 tally, Azalea launched her second entry, as Grande's \"Problem\" roared in at No. 3. (The same week, Azalea's \"Work\" entered at No. 88; the cut climbs 77-63 this week.)\nExpanding beyond only artists' first two Hot 100 hits placing up at Nos. 1 and 2 in the same week, Azalea is the 15th act to double up at those ranks with any two titles. She's the first since Pharrell Williams did so for five weeks last year as featured on Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\" (also featuring T.I.) and Daft Punk's \"Get Lucky.\" She's just the third woman to rank at Nos. 1 and 2 concurrently, following Mariah Carey (Sept. 10, 2005) and Ashanti (five weeks, 2002).\nAzalea additionally becomes only the fourth solo female rapper ever to top the Hot 100. Lauryn Hill was the first, having taken her debut solo hit \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" to No. 1 for two weeks in November 1998. (She had first made her mark with the Fugees.) In 2001, Lil' Kim led for five weeks with Christina Aguilera, Mya and P!nk on \"Lady Marmalade,\" while Shawnna assisted Ludacris on \"Stand Up,\" which topped the Dec. 6, 2003, chart.\nNotably, a pair of other prominent female rappers have yet to reach the Hot 100's summit. Among her nine top 10s, Missy Elliott climbed to No. 2 twice: for 10 weeks in 2002 with \"Work It\" and for seven frames in 2005 as a guest on Ciara's \"1, 2 Step.\" Nicki Minaj has also tallied nine top 10s, reaching No. 3 twice, both in 2011: as featured on Britney Spears' \"Till the World Ends\" and with her own \"Super Bass.\" This week, Minaj debuts at No. 47 on the Hot 100 with her new single \"Pills N Potions.\"\n(Honorable mention to Blondie, who, led by frontwoman Debbie Harry, is widely regarded as scoring the Hot 100's first rap No. 1, \"Rapture,\" in 1981.)\nNot to be lost in the celebration of Azalea's new Hot 100 leader, Charli XCX likewise lands her first No. 1. In her sole prior visit, the U.K. pop singer/songwriter peaked at No. 7 a year ago this month as featured on Icona Pop's \"I Love It.\"\nPop Shop Podcast: Coldplay, Chromeo Interview\nIn this week's episode, we discuss Coldplay's \"Ghost Stories\" and chat with Chromeo about their new album \"White Women.\" Subscribe to the podcast on iTunes  HERE .\nUntil this week, the last time that at least two solo women had teamed for a Hot 100 No. 1? Rihanna and Britney Spears sent \"S&M\" to the top of the April 30, 2011, chart. That title marked the first all-solo female No. 1 collab since \"Lady Marmalade\" nearly 10 years earlier. (The last pairing of only two solo women at the summit prior to \"Fancy\" and \"S&M\"? Brandy and Monica, who fought their way to No. 1 for 13 weeks in 1998 with \"The Boy Is Mine.\")\n(One other fun fact regarding the coronation of \"Fancy\": the new Hot 100 is dated June 7, 2014. That makes for a perfect birthday present for the soon-to-be 24-year-old Azalea, who was born on June 7, 1990.)\nHow did \"Fancy\" fly to the Hot 100's top spot? The song surges by sweeping the chart's top Digital, Streaming and Airplay Gainer awards (for the second time in four weeks). It rises 2-1 on Digital Songs with a 44 percent gain to 336,000 downloads sold, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Aiding the song's advance? Azalea and Charli XCX performed it on the Billboard Music Awards on May 18, the day before the latest sales tracking week began on May 19. \"Fancy\" spends a second week at No. 1 on Streaming Songs (14 million U.S. streams, up 66 percent, according to Nielsen BDS) and reaches the Radio Songs top five (7-5; 104 million, up 23 percent).\n\"Problem,\" meanwhile, pushes 3-2 on the Hot 100, also with gains in each of the chart's three metrics. It dips 1-2 on Digital Songs after spending its first three weeks at No. 1, but grows by 15 percent to 284,000. Grande likewise sang the song on the Billboard Music Awards (after Azalea performed \"Fancy\"; Azalea returned to the stage to join Grande for \"Problem\"). It slips 2-3 on Streaming Songs (10.4 million, up 39 percent) and bounds 16-10 on Radio Songs top 10 (73 million, up 30 percent), where it's her first top 10 hit; her debut single, \"The Way,\" featuring Mac Miller, reached No. 12 on Radio Songs last year.\nAs she competes with herself (and Grande) at No. 2, Azalea handily lands the Hot 100's top spot, as \"Fancy\" (up 46 percent) boasts 28 percent more overall chart points than \"Problem\" (up 25 percent).\n\"Fancy\" additionally claims the No. 1 spot on the sales/airplay/streaming-based Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart (2-1).\n\"Fancy\" dethrones John Legend's \"All of Me\" on both the Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs after three weeks at No. 1 on each list; it falls 1-3 on the Hot 100. Still, \"All\" logs a fifth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (162 million, down 8 percent). It drops 3-4 on Digital Songs (147,000, down 7 percent) and 4-5 on Streaming Songs (7.3 million, down 2 percent). Legend also performed \"All\" on the Billboard Music Awards.\nThe next four titles on the Hot 100 maintain their ranks from last week: Pharrell Williams' former 10-week No. 1 \"Happy\" (No. 4); DJ Snake and Lil Jon's \"Turn Down for What\" (No. 5), which also crowns the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart for a ninth week; Katy Perry's former four-week No. 1 \"Dark Horse,\" featuring Juicy J (No. 6); and Jason Derulo's No. 3-peaking \"Talk Dirty,\" featuring 2 Chainz (No. 7). (Read on for details on Derulo's new top 10.)\nNorwegian pop duo Nico & Vinz blasts 17-8 with its first Hot 100 hit, \"Am I Wrong.\" The  track soars 6-3 on Digital Songs (156,000, up 36 percent), debuts at No. 16 on Streaming Songs (3.1 million, up 83 percent) and roars 30-20 on Radio Songs (52 million, up 26 percent). (The pair is the second Norwegian duo to reach the Hot 100's top 10 in recent months: comedic twosome Ylvis scampered to No. 6 in October with \"The Fox.\")\nJustin Timberlake's \"Not a Bad Thing\" retreats to No. 9 on the Hot 100 from its No. 8 highpoint. Still, it advances 3-2 on Radio Songs with a 3 percent increase to 124 million. As previously reported , \"Thing\" climbs 2-1 on the Pop Songs radio airplay chart, pushing Timberlake past Bruno Mars for the most No. 1s by a solo male (seven) in the chart's history. \nRounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Derulo's \"Wiggle,\" featuring Snoop Dogg, vaults 20-10. Derulo sang the song as part of a medley with \"Talk Dirty\" on the Billboard Music Awards (with Snoop Dogg and 2 Chainz). The track rises 8-7 on Digital Songs (124,000, up 14 percent) and 13-8 on Streaming Songs (5.4 million, up 60 percent), while nearing Radio Songs (19 million, up 82 percent). \"Wiggle\" marks Derulo's fifth Hot 100 top 10 and, following \"Dirty,\" grants him consecutive top 10s for the first time since his first three chart hits all made the top 10 in 2009-10: \"Whatcha Say\" (No. 1, one week), \"In My Head' (No. 5) and \"Ridin' Solo\" (No. 9). With \"Dirty\" and \"Wiggle\" at Nos. 7 and 10, respectively, Derulo posts concurrent top 10s for the first time.\nMeanwhile, Snoop Dogg scores his 11th Hot 100 top 10. He'd last reached the region with Wiz Khalifa on \"Young, Wild & Free,\" featuring Mars, in early 2012. He tallied his first top 10 more than 20 years ago with \"What's My Name?,\" his first chart hit which climbed to No. 8 in January 1994.\nWith two new Hot 100 top 10s, two titles depart the top tier: Michael Jackson and Timberlake's \"Love Never Felt So Good\" (9-16), a week after Jackson became the first artist to reach the top 10 in five different decades , and Coldplay's \"A Sky Full of Stars\" (10-32). \nVisit Billboard.com tomorrow (May 29), when all rankings, including the Hot 100 in its entirety and Digital Songs, Radio Songs, Streaming Songs and On-Demand Songs, will refresh, as they do each Thursday."

    "content": "June 4 2014 9:07 AM\nWhy is Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy” No. 1?\nBy Chris Molanphy\n \nMusically speaking, Charli XCX, on the left, is the real standout on the no. 1 hit by Iggy Azalea (right).\nPhoto by Ethan Miller/Getty Images\nThree decades ago, in an interview with chart-trivia master Fred Bronson for his Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits , Blondie lead singer Debbie Harry said the following about 1981’s “Rapture” —the song with the rap about the man from Mars who’s eatin’ cars, and the first Hot 100 No. 1 song to feature rapping.\n“It took some getting used to for the guys [in the band],” Harry said. “They really weren’t solidly behind rap music at the time. It was very underground … They thought it might have been a little too much.”\nAdvertisement\nDiscussing what, if anything, she would go back and change about her performance, Harry added: “I think I would do the rap a little, what I would call tighter, more precise. To me it’s a little bit off the beat. I only did one take on it and that was it. So if I were to do it again, I would have done a couple more takes.”\nMuch as I hate to disagree with Harry about her art—she and Blondie co-leader Chris Stein followed their muse to four stellar No. 1 songs, each in a vastly different style —she’s at least a little bit wrong on both counts. First, the other members of Blondie were probably wise to be wary about attempting rap; besides imperiling their rock bona fides, it may have felt like one cultural appropriation too far. And second, the slackness of Harry’s rap may be the best thing about “Rapture.” Its shambling quality is true to Harry’s urban-white-girl persona, saving it from the kind of appropriation the rest of the band likely feared. Thank heavens she didn’t try another take.\nThirty-three years later, one white lady who doesn’t hesitate to appropriate is Iggy Azalea. The 23-year-old Australian model and rapper possesses the new No. 1 song on the Hot 100 , “Fancy” featuring Charli XCX.\nFor Azalea, born Amethyst Amelia Kelly in New South Wales, there’s no second-guessing or wishing for another take. Iggy thinks she’s awesome, and she’s here to tell you: “Honest, the truth is—my flow, retarded; each beat, dear, departed.” Having relocated to Miami at age 16, she adopted the argot and flow of an African-American from the Dirty South; hip-hop academic and critic Oliver Wang calls it “a hat trick of appropriation: not American, not black, not southern.” As if leaning into the criticism, Iggy unleashes the bravado within “Fancy’s” first 10 seconds, in the song’s most memorable and oft-quoted rhyme: “First things first: I’m the realest,” a statement laced with either unwitting irony or sardonic self-commentary—probably both.\nAdvertisement\nAzalea’s peacocking and overcompensation make a kind of sense, inasmuch as very few female rappers of any race have ever topped Billboard’s premier song chart. Besides Harry, who doesn’t even rap all the way through “Rapture,” there’s Lauryn Hill, who made it to No. 1 in 1998 with “Doo Wop (That Thing),” her singing-and-rapping take on ’60s girl-group soul. Three years later, rapper Lil Kim shared credit on a No. 1, the 2001 remake of Labelle’s “Lady Marmalade,” a four-diva pile-up that also featured Christina Aguilera, Mya, and P!nk. And, unless you consider Ke$ha a rapper—a valid but not-uncontroversial opinion held by, among others, the New York Times’ Jon Caramanica —that’s it for lead female rappers at No. 1, until Azalea this week. (Among many injustices, rap godmothers Salt-n-Pepa peaked at No. 3 on the Hot 100, and hip-hop innovator Missy Elliott has never gotten past No. 2 .)\nSo let’s give it up for the ladies who rap—even if Azalea’s play-acting has been called everything from minstrelsy to, more charitably, rap’s greatest drag performance . I have written my share in the past six months about the charts, race, and how the digital era has given a lift to hegemonic pop culture; we needn’t go there again. Besides, the title of this series isn’t “Why is cultural appropriation so profitable?” (Short answer: It always has been .) It’s “Why is this song No. 1?” And it has to be said that “Fancy” is crafted like a Swiss watch.\nAs a pop-radio dominator, “Fancy” has two big things going for it: tight production and a great supporting performer. Rhythmically the song is electro-hop, powered not by a traditional rap breakbeat but by a rubbery synth bounce. That sound is indebted to early-’80s electro-rap pioneer Afrika Bambaataa , Nu Shooz’s 1986 pop&B classic “I Can’t Wait,” and late-’80s female-rap trio JJ Fad . “Fancy’s” London-based production team The Invisible Men , working with co-producer Kurtis “The Arcade” McKenzie, have reduced the song’s sonic footprint to little more than that digital pulse and a recurring skitter-step beat, which owes more than a little to the 2004 smash “Tipsy” by J-Kwon .\nBut of all the talents swirling around “Fancy,” the song’s true MVP is its featured performer, Charlotte Aitchison, aka Charli XCX, possessor of the Gwen Stefani–like voice that coos the song’s sticky hook. If her voice sounds familiar, it’s probably because you spent last summer strutting to it, too: The pavement-crusher “I Love It,” credited to Swedish duo Icona Pop featuring Charli XCX (a 2012 single that took a full year to emerge), was largely Aitchison’s confection. So “Fancy” makes this the second straight year the British singer-songwriter has powered a monster summer jam credited to others that sprang in large part from her head. Further evidence of Charli’s skill can be found on her critically acclaimed 2013 album True Romance, packed with chewy hooks that have pop fans falling over themselves to praise her. (Could someone please get this lady a hit of her own now, please?)\nAdvertisement\nCompared to Charli’s monster hook, Azalea’s rapping is the track’s weaker sister. Iggy may be a more confident rapper than Debbie Harry in 1981, but she also sounds like she’s trying really hard. But what’s grating over the length of Azalea’s album The New Classic is more charming on a supple pop single; her effortfulness kind of works here. Having trained herself to rap in a cadence vastly different from her native speaking voice , Iggy’s comes off brash but studied , and she resembles no one so much as her mentor , Atlanta rapper T.I. Listen to the way her tone rises on the line “You should want a bad bitch like this, hah?”—a clear homage to T.I.’s singsongy, conversational tone on smashes like “Live Your Life” or his rap bridge on Justin Timberlake’s classic “My Love.” They say that good artists copy and great artists steal. Azalea is, at her best, a competent copycat, and she’s unafraid to insert herself into the lineage of rap’s greats. Her line about a rooftop in ’88 isn’t nostalgia for a time before Azalea was born: It’s an allusion to a rhyme by Nas .\nBut forget the ’80s and the ’00s: Iggy is, to borrow a term from Charli’s other big hit, “a ’90s bitch.” That’s confirmed by the song’s YouTube-dominating music video , an homage to Clueless, the 1995 Alicia Silverstone comedy. Billboard reports that the video was a linchpin in the song’s climb to No. 1, having been viewed some 60 million times since its March debut. With the 20-year nostalgia cycle in full effect, Amy Heckerling’s teen-cinema masterwork was right on schedule for homage, though it’s hard to see what Azalea brings to the party other than recreating some the film’s best scenes and looking cute in Cher Horowitz’s yellow plaid . If you squint pretty hard, you can see the video saying something about how young people—suburban teens or arriviste rappers—construct themselves; though, honestly, that may be giving a clip likely dreamed up in a marketing meeting ( “Is this, like, a Noxzema commercial or what?!” ) more credit than it deserves.\nBetween the smash music video and a sales-juicing TV performance in mid-May on the Billboard Music Awards, “Fancy” got its momentum to reach No. 1. During that same BBMAs performance , Azalea joined big-lunged pop star Ariana Grande for a performance of “Problem,” the Ariana-fronted, Iggy-supported single that’s currently No. 2 on the Hot 100. These songs’ dual command of the chart has led to online chatter about just how Zeitgeist-dominant Azalea is right now.\nAs if stirring the pot, Billboard noted that Azalea is the first act to capture the chart’s top two positions with her first two Hot 100 hits since the Beatles. Any Billboard feat involving a modern pop act and the phrase “since the Beatles” is guaranteed to rile up chart nerds, but the record is a footnote and an accident—for both acts. It’s no proud statistic for the Fab Four, who didn’t chart in America until early 1964 only because the band’s U.S. label refused to promote its records here sooner; once Beatlemania reached American shores, a flood of singles on multiple labels rushed the Hot 100, sending “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and “She Loves You” to the top two positions even though other Beatles singles should have charted earlier. And Azalea should have scored lower-charting hits as far back as 2011, except that complicated label politics , and a slew of tracks recorded under prior contracts but withheld from promotion, essentially kept her off the radio more than two years, before Island Records finally sent her into the studio to record her “official” debut.\nThe other act Azalea’s being freely compared to this summer, thanks to her hit duopoly, is Summer 2013 dominator Pharrell Williams. With “Fancy” and “Problem” set to duke it out for the Hot 100 penthouse over many weeks, much the way last year’s two Pharrell-supported hits held down Nos. 1 and 2 for more than a month, Azalea is looking like Summer 2014’s special sauce. But Azalea isn’t a supporting performer on “Fancy,” she’s the lead. And anyway she doesn’t have the decades of history Pharrell built as a writer-producer—if anyone right now deserves the X-factor designation, it’s Charli XCX. About the only thing Pharrell and Iggy have in common is taking a turn as America’s shiny new object after hiding in plain sight.\nUltimately, the success of “Fancy” is owed largely to timing, which is the dark art of major-label pop promotion. Knowing when a style—in this case, ’80s/’90s–referencing electro-rap—is ascendant is a skill in itself, and after years of Azalea scoring more headlines than hits, her team managed to make her seem new again. Whether “Fancy” signals longevity for her is another matter. For Blondie in 1981, “Rapture” came at the end of a great two-year run as New Wave’s biggest band; neither the group nor Debbie Harry came anywhere near Billboard’s Top 10 again. Shambling rap may have closed their career, but now it’s 2014, not 1981. If Iggy Azalea truly is “the realest,” a career as hip-hop’s leading lady is now hers to lose.\nPreviously in Why Is This Song No. 1?"

The opinions expressed are those of the writer.\nLoading ...\nLoading ...\nThis story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe\nSummer's over and it’s official: Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy” is the Song of the Summer, and it turns out it was no close call .\nBillboard has a chart specifically dedicated to tracking and ultimately deciding what the Song of the Summer will be, and it shows that Iggy was going to take the honor from the beginning. “Fancy” was the top song for the entire summer on that tally, blocking anyone else from taking control for even a single frame. The chart factors in how well a song is performing on the Hot 100 week by week from Memorial Day to Labor Day.\nThe Australian rapper’s breakout hit sat at number one on the Hot 100 for seven straight weeks, starting the first week of June. It then sat at number one on the main register for half of the summer, remaining in the top five for six weeks after it backed down from the top spot. So, for the fourteen weeks of summer than are included in the Song of the Summer chart, “Fancy” was in the top five for thirteen of them, only dipping out for the last week.\nIggy Azalea in the video for \"Fancy\" (Virgin EMI Records)\nRight behind “Fancy” (which also features Charli XCX on the chorus) is another newcomer. Canadian reggae band MAGIC!’s debut hit “Rude” is number two on the list. The song recently also left the pinnacle of the American charts, ceding the slot to Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off” . “Rude” ruled the Hot 100 for six weeks, but came too late in the season to tackle Azalea.\nAs if running the show for an entire season wasn’t good enough, Iggy Azalea is also in the number three spot on the Songs of the Summer final listing. Sharing the space with Ariana Grande, their hit “Problem” was apparently the third most popular track this summer, and though it only got as high as number two on the Hot 100 (where it sat for over a month), it did help both Azalea and Grande join the exclusive group of women who have had three top ten hits at the same time.\nWomen seem to have a hold on summer hits, as they are typically on top when the last data comes out after Labor Day. The last time a woman had the Song of the Summer was in 2012, when Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me Maybe” was just as inescapable as “Fancy” was this year. That song was also her first hit in the States, as “Fancy” was for Iggy. In fact, in the last ten years, women have had lead billing on seven of the number one Songs of the Summer, and have been featured on another two. In the last decade, the only track to end the season at number one without having a female vocal on it was last year, when Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” (which featured Pharrell and TI) took the honor."

Although there is no sharp physiographic separation between the peninsula and Central Europe, the line of the Sava and Danube rivers is commonly considered as the region's northern limit. The Balkan Peninsula therefore includes most of Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia, continental Greece (including the Peloponnesus), Bulgaria, European Turkey, and SE Romania. These countries, successors to the Ottoman Empire, are called the Balkan States. Historically and politically the region extends north of this line to include all of Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, and Romania.\nThe peninsula is very mountainous; the main ranges are the Dinaric Alps, the Balkans, the Rhodope Mts., and the Pindus. Except for the barren Karst plateau in the northwest and the eroded highlands of Greece, the mountains are densely forested. The Morava, Vardar, Strimón, Mesta, and Maritsa are the largest rivers. The Morava and Vardar river valleys form the chief corridor across the peninsula. The mild Mediterranean-type climate, with its dry summer period, is limited to the southern and coastal areas. Covering a greater area are the humid subtropical climate in the northwest and the harsher humid continental climate in the northeast. The region as a whole is largely agricultural; fruits, grains, and grazing are important. A variety of mineral deposits are found there, including iron ore, coal, manganese, copper, lead, and zinc.\nThe peoples of the Balkan Peninsula make up several racial groups. However, linguistic and religious differences are more distinct than the racial divisions. The peninsula, at the crossroads of European and Asian civilizations, has a long history; Ancient Greece, the Byzantine Empire, and the Ottoman Empire flourished there.\nSee R. D. Kaplan, Balkan Ghosts (1994);.\nM. Tedorov, Imagining the Balkans (1997);.\nM. Mazower, The Balkans: A Short History (2000).\nThe Columbia Encyclopedia, © Columbia University Press 2016"

    "content": "The Mediterranean Sea | Geography, History, Economy and Environmental Problems\nContact\nThe Mediterranean Sea\nThe Mediterranean Sea is a body of water that is almost completely surrounded by  land. It lies between three continents: Europe to the north, Asia to the east  and Africa to the south. Africa. It stretches over 2,500 miles (4000 km) from Gibraltar to Israel. The Mediterranean is connected to the Atlantic through a 14  km wide strait, where Europe and  Africa meet. The Suez Canal links it to the Red Sea and the Bosporus to the  Black Sea.\nThe Mediterranean Sea covers an area of over 2.5 million square kilometers (950 000  square miles).  It is divided into different parts by islands and peninsulas.  The Aegean is the sea between Greece and Turkey, the Adriatic Sea lies between  Italy and the Balkan Peninsula and the Tyrrhenian Sea is between Italy and its  western islands.\nThe coastline of the Mediterranean  is made up of many bays and inlets. Three large peninsulas, the  Iberian, the Italian and the Balkans reach out into the Mediterranean Sea.  Among the largest islands in the Mediterranean are Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia  and Crete .\nThe Mediterranean region is often called the cradle of civilization because many  early cultures and civilizations developed along its shores.\nMap of the Mediterranean Sea\n \nGeology\nThe Mediterranean Sea was formed through movements of the Earth’s plates . When the ancient landmass of Pangaea broke apart about 250 million years ago  a huge ocean, the Tethys, evolved around its middle. This ocean extended to the north of today’s Alps and to the east as far as the  Ural Mountains. When Africa and Europe started moving towards each other this ocean became smaller. The Mediterranean Sea  is what is left of this large ancient ocean.\nGeologists think that the Mediterranean dried up several times in the last few million  years because the Strait of Gibraltar closed and reopened, allowing water  from the Atlantic to flow in.\nToday the whole Mediterranean region is still very active. Earthquakes hit the Balkans, Italy and Turkey regularly. The region’s volcanoes , for example Mt.  Etna and Stromboli, are among the most active in Europe. Mount Vesuvius became  known for its famous eruption in 79  A.D. which wiped out the Roman town of Pompeii.\n \nClimate\nThe Mediterranean region has a special climate that can be found in  other parts of the world, like South Africa or southeastern Australia . The  summers are very hot and dry with almost no rain at all, while winters are mild  and rainy.\n \nWater of the Mediterranean\nThe Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1 500  meters or over 5,000 feet.\nThe Po, Nile , Rhone and Ebro are the largest rivers that flow into the sea. They  all create deltas because there are no currents that carry the water away. Tides are  not as strong as they are in the Atlantic Ocean . The difference between high and low tide is only about 0.5 meters.\nBecause of its hot climate much water evaporates and the sea has a higher concentration of salt than  other oceans, especially in the  eastern part where the water temperature is also higher.\n \nCatania , Sicily with Mount Etna in the background - BenAveling\n \nEconomy\nThe Mediterranean attracts millions of tourists every  year. About one third of global tourism takes place here. Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey rely on tourism for a large part of their yearly income.\nAlthough it is very dry during  the summer months, farming plays an important role in the region. Olives,  oranges and grapes are grown. The Mediterranean is the world’s most important  wine-growing region. Apart from that farmers grow other crops, especially  wheat and barley. A small part of  the coastal population earns their  money by fishing.  \nRecently, natural gas and oil  have been discovered in the Aegean  Sea, causing a conflict between  Greece and Turkey.\n \nHistory\nAncient cultures in Greece , Egypt and Rome and Phoenicia developed along the shores of the  Mediterranean region. The people of these civilizations not only traded with others  but sailed over the calm seas to enlarge their territories through warfare.\nFor hundreds of years the Mediterranean Sea was the main water  route.  Muslims controlled a large part of  the Mediterranean throughout the  early part of the Middle Ages . Some centuries later Venice and Florence became the world’s main trading centers. However , when Vasco da Gama sailed around  Africa during the Age of Exploration the trade  route across the Mediterranean to Asia became less important. This changed  when the Suez Canal opened in 1869. The Europeans had a new trade route through  the Red Sea to their colonies Asia.\n \nEnvironmental Problems in the Mediterranean Region\nEnvironmental problems are a big challenge to the future of the Mediterranean region.\nClimate change and global warming could raise the sea level of  the Mediterranean as much as 60 cm and, thus, flood parts of the Nile Delta or the  city of Venice.\nPollution has become widespread along the coasts of the  Mediterranean as tourism dumps thousands of tons of sewage into the  sea each year.\nAlthough many coastal areas  and small islands of the Mediterranean depend on tourism as a main source of income it has also driven  animal life away from the shores.  Sea turtles are in danger of becoming extinct because tourists take away their nesting  places.\nThe Mediterranean is one of the world’s busiest shipping routes. Oil is carried through tankers from the Middle  East to ports in Italy and France. Leaky tankers and washing containers at  sea contribute to water pollution of the Mediterranean. Some ships  carry heavy metals and other poisonous material.\nOverfishing has also become a problem in the Mediterranean region. Over  60% of all fish species are in  danger of dying out.\nRecently, the countries surrounding the Mediterranean region  have been moving closer together in an attempt to protect the region.\n \nPollution of a Mediterranean coastline - Courtesy Algalita.org\n \nbarley = a plant that  produces grain which  is used for food  and alcohol\nbay = a part of the sea  that is enclosed by a curve of the land\nbusy = here: a lot of  traffic\ncalm = quiet\ncoastline = where water meets  land\ncolony = country that not  free but controlled by another country\ncompletely = wholly, all of it\nconnect = link\ncover = to lie over\ncradle = here: the place where  something begins\ncrop = plant, like wheat, corn  or rice that is grown by farmers and sold as food\ncurrent = the movement of  water in an ocean, lake or river\ndelta = area of low land  where a river spreads into many smaller rivers and flows into the ocean\ndepth = how deep something is\ndevelop = grow\ndiscover = to find for the  first time\ndivide = separate\ndump  = unload\nearthquake = a sudden shaking of  the Earth’s surface that causes a lot of damage and kills people\nenlarge = expand, make larger\neruption = the outbreak of a  volcano\nespecially = above all\n evaporate = water changes into gas\nevolve = grow\nflood = to cover with water\nflow = pour, rush\nglobal = worldwide\nheavy metal = metal that has a  high density, like gold or lead; many of them are poisonous\nhigh  tide = the time when the  sea reaches its highest level\nhowever = but\nincome = money you get for something  you do\ninlet = narrow area of  water that reaches from the sea into the land\nleaky = with a hole in it  so that oil or gas can pass through\nlocation = where something is\nlow tide = the time when the  sea reaches its lowest level\nmain = most important\nmovement = when something moves\nnesting place = here: where they  come to lay their eggs\npeninsula = piece of land with  water all around it connected to a large area of land\nplate = one of the many  large sheets of rock that form the Earth’s  surface\npoisonous = deadly\npollution = the process of  making air, water , soil etc.. dirty and unusable\nport = harbor ; where  ships load and unload their goods\nrecently = shortly, in the last  few years\nregularly =all the time, often\nreopen = open again\nsea level = the average height  of the sea\nseveral = many\nsewage = used water and the  waste of the human body that is carried away from pipes in houses\nshore = coast\nsource = where something comes  from\nspecies = group of animals or  plants that are similar and can have babies together\nstrait = a narrow passage of  water between two areas of land\nstretch = reach from one  place to another\nsurrounded = to be around  something\nthroughout = in all of\ntide = the regular rising  and falling of the sea\ntowards = in the direction of\ntrade = to buy and sell things\ntrade route = road, path or sea  passage used to transport goods\nwarfare = the activity of  fighting a war\nwidespread = common"

    "content": "Alexander the Great\nAlexander the Great\nUkrainian translation\nWorld conqueror, 356 B.C. - 323 B.C.\nI'm holding a handful of arrowheads that may have been shot from the bow of Alexander the Great .\nOK, that's a bit of a fantasy. But it's not too unlikely that these came from Alexander's army. These arrowheads were unearthed in Macedonia and date to the 4th century B.C., the century when Alexander and his men conquered most of the known world.\nAlexander is one of the most fascinating personalities in human history. Although he was the son of a king and inherited an empire that included most of the Greek city-states, Alexander's own conquests are what have made him admired, vilified, emulated, and studied for over two millennia.\nThrough the years, so many stories have been told and retold about Alexander the Great that he has become more like a character from Greek mythology than a real human being. This, I'm sure, would have made him very happy. Being a Greek hero was always his ambition.\nClick here for the route Alexander followed. ]\nAlexander's ambition\nGrowing up, Alexander was fascinated by Homer's Iliad. It was the character of Achilles -- the hero of the story and the exemplar of all manly virtues -- that especially attracted him.\n[Alexander. Click here for a larger image. Glyptothek Munich, Germany.] Sometime in his early formative years he decided to model himself after Achilles.\nEmulating the famous hero was apparently encouraged by his teacher, the great philosopher Aristotle. According to the Roman historian Plutarch, Aristotle personally annotated a copy of the Iliad for Alexander. Alexander kept it with him throughout all his later travels, even sleeping with it under his pillow.\nAlexander's mother, Olympias, clearly encouraged him. This woman couldn't have been more meddling and ambitious for Alexander if she herself were a scheming goddess on Mount Olympus. In fact, she may have consorted with the gods. Or, at least, that's the rumor she spread.\nOlympias informed her son that he was actually a descendent of Achilles. And probably Hercules, too.\n[Marble statue from Gabii Louvre, Paris, France. Click here for a larger image. ]\nAnd so, in keeping with his family tradition and the great expectations of his mother, Alexander looked for any opportunity to demonstrate his heroic strength and courage.\nIn one episode, his father -- Philip II of Macedonia -- was considering purchasing a magnificent black stallion. But the horse was too wild. Nobody believed it could be tamed. The 14-year-old Alexander decided he could do it. He leapt onto its back and started a 16-year relationship with the horse, which he named Bucephalas.\nAs the story goes, Philip was so proud of Alexander that he said to him: \"My son, look thee out a kingdom equal to and worthy of thyself, for Macedonia is too little for thee.\"\nAlexander inherits a kingdom\nWhen Alexander was 16, Philip made him regent of Macedonia while he was off fighting the Persians. (Nominally at least, Philip's campaign was revenge for Xerxes' Persian invasion of Greece, some 150 years earlier.) While regent, Alexander crushed an uprising in Thrace.\nWhen Alexander was 18, Philip left him in command of the left wing of the Macedonian army at the battle of Chaeronea. The battle was won, thanks in part to a courageous cavalry charge led by Alexander himself.\nWhen Alexander was 20, Philip was assassinated. A guard plunged a spear into his chest. Some say it was a conspiracy orchestrated by Olympias.\nAnd so, Alexander inherited a kingdom.\nAlexander conquers his world\nInheriting a kingdom from his father didn't really please Alexander. What kind of hero gets everything given to him? This wouldn't satisfy Achilles or Hercules and it wouldn't satisfy him.\n[Nationalmuseum in Naples. Click here for a larger image. See this page for a series of larger portraits.] Alexander wanted to get started conquering ASAP.\nHe got his first opportunity almost immediately. Some of the Greek city-states saw the ascension of the 20-year-old Alexander as a chance to regain their independence from the foreign Macedonians. By the way, \"foreign\" is how the Greeks saw the Macedonians, not how the Macedonians saw themselves. To this day, there's still contention over whether Macedonians are Greeks.\nAlexander took care of the little rebellion post-haste. To set an example, he completely razed the Greek city of Thebes in 335 B.C., killing most of the population -- including women and children -- and enslaving those few left alive. After that the Greeks were happily united behind Alexander and he could focus his attention on expanding the empire.\nHe immediately began pushing east, against the old enemy Persia -- which his father never succeeded in defeating.\nAfter winning a battle for the city of Gordium, Alexander is said to have solved the famously tricky Gordian Knot. He sliced through the thing with his sword rather than fool around it. A legend supposedly foretold that whoever solved this puzzle would rule all of Asia.\nAlexander rapidly moved on to destroy the city of Tyre ... push through Palestine, Syria, Iran, and Afghanistan ... and conquer Egypt (or, depending on your perspective, \"liberate\" Egypt from the Persians). In bloody battle after bloody battle the Persian Empire and most of the known world fell to the hero Alexander and his Macedonian war machine.\n[Alexander's empire. Click here for a larger image. ]\nAlexandria, Virginia to Alexander Beach, Washington\nFor his greater glory, Alexander founded some 70 cities in the lands he conquered and ordered them named after himself. Most famous, of course, is Alexandria in Egypt. In India, when his beloved horse died, he ordered a city to be built named Bucephala.\nIn 11 years, from 335 B.C. to 324 B.C., Alexander and his army battled their way across 22,000 miles.\nFor perspective on that distance, think about traveling across America eight times, say, from Alexandria, Virginia to Alexander Beach, Washington. (Although Alexander did not conquer North America it's interesting to note that there are nearly two dozen cities and towns here named Alexander or Alexandria.)\nFor most of Alexander's army these miles were traveled on foot. There's speculation that some of the grueling miles weren't even necessary, except to confirm Alexander's status as a hero.\nIn 324 B.C., Alexander decided to march his army through the barren wasteland of the Gedrosian desert in present-day Iran. Some say he could have made this trip easy by sailing his troops through the Persian Gulf instead, but he decided to go through the desert as a challenge -- because no one had ever successfully brought an army through it.\nAlthough the number is probably widely exaggerated, the Roman historian Arrian claimed that three quarters of Alexander's men died during this misadventure in the desert.\nSon of Zeus\nAs I mentioned above, Olympias had told her son that he was a direct descendent of Achilles, on her side. Later she revealed to him something even more dramatic about his lineage. Philip was not his real father. Zeus was his father.\n[The beautiful, scheming Olympias. From a medal. Click here for a larger image. ]\nZeus, the king of the Greek gods, had come to Olympias in the form of a snake.\nAs a matter of fact, Philip did acknowledge that his wife would sometimes sleep with snakes in their bed. This may have been part of the reason for their estrangement. Around 336 B.C. Philip effectively \"divorced\" Olympias and fathered children without her. This was about the same time that Philip was assassinated and Alexander inherited his throne.\nIn 331 B.C., the Egyptian oracle at Siwa confirmed that Alexander was the son of the Zeus. Actually, the oracle confirmed that he was the son of Ammon, but Ammon is the Egyptian equivalent of Zeus in nearly as clear a way as Jupiter is his Roman equivalent.\nWas Olympias schizophrenic? Was Alexander a crazed megalomaniac?\nMaybe, but they did have a quite practical reason for claiming that Alexander was a god or demi-god, and may or may not have ever believed it themselves. It helped Alexander rule.\nAlexander's divine reputation helped him keep his tenuous hold over the people in his vast and disparate empire. It was an early precursor to the European monarchs' claims about the divine right of kings.\nGrief, ennui, and death\nFor Alexander, the beginning of the end came when his best friend Hephaestion died of a fever. Hephaestion had been his close companion since they were teenagers. Many scholars say that Alexander and Hephaestion were lovers.\nHephaestion's death was devastating to Alexander.\nPlutarch writes:\nAt this misfortune, Alexander was so beyond all  reason transported that, to express his sorrow,  he immediately ordered the manes and tails of all  his horses and mules to be cut .... The poor  physician he crucified .... Then seeking to  alleviate his grief in war, he set out, as it were,  to a hunt and chase of men, for he fell upon the  Cossaeans, and put the whole nation to the sword.\nSince this seems a bit extreme, even for a best friend and lover, some historians have speculated that Alexander was imitating the extravagance of Achilles when he grieved over the death of his best friend and lover Patroklos.\nAccording to the Iliad, to satisfy his heroic grief, Achilles supposedly killed Trojans by the hundreds, beheaded children, and dragged the body of Hektor, Patroklos's killer, around and around Patroklos's body for a week or two.\n[Silver drachm featuring Alexander, minted after his death, ca. 310 B.C. Click here for a larger image. ] In the same year as Hephaestion's death, 324 B.C., Alexander's generals convinced him to withdraw from the action at the eastern frontier in order to consolidate his power back in Babylon, the capital of the empire.\nThis is not what Alexander wanted. He was supposed to be a hero. He had no interest in sitting on a throne administering to the business of an empire. He wanted to be on his horse, sword in hand, conquering new lands.\nAlexander reluctantly spent the next year in Babylon, without Bucephalas, without Hephaestion, and without the action and glory of battle.\nPerhaps the inertia ate away at his soul. Plutarch writes that Alexander \"lost his spirits, and grew diffident of the protection and assistance of the gods, and suspicious of his friends.\"\nAlexander drank heavily, and in a weakened state he caught a fever. After twelve days of suffering he died in Babylon at the age of 33.\nGlory\n[Alexander and Bucephalas. Click here for a larger image. Nationalmuseum in Naples.] The Macedonian empire didn't live much longer than Alexander. After his death his kingdom was promptly carved up into three pieces by his generals.\nAnd the Macedonian people have never seen much peace or freedom. They've been under the feet of ambitious conquerors from the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, and the Turkish Empire. More recently, their country was carved up between the world wars and made a part of communist Yugoslavia.\nBut Alexander did win his glory. He fulfilled his ambition.\nHe is quoted as saying, \"I would rather live a short life of glory than a long one of obscurity.\"\nThat's exactly what he got. 2,300 years later we remember him as a legendary, mythic figure.\nFor illustrations, Web links, books, and more information related to Alexander the Great, archery, and early metallurgy, click to http://www.interesting.com/stories/alexander/more.html ."

    "content": "Alexander the Great Biography - family, children, parents, death, history, wife, mother, young, son\nAlexander the Great Biography\nBabylon\nMacedonian king\nAlexander the Great was one of the best-known rulers in ancient history.       By the time of his death at thirty-two, he ruled the largest Western       empire of the ancient world.\nEducation by tutors\nAlexander was born in 356\nB.C.E.\nto King Philip II of Macedon (382–336\nB.C.E.\n) and Queen Olympias (375–316\nB.C.E.\n). Growing up, Alexander rarely saw his father, who was usually involved         in long military campaigns. Olympias, a fierce and possessive mother,         dominated her son's youth and filled him with a deep resentment         of his father. Nonetheless, their son's education was important         to both parents.\nAlexander the Great.\nOne of Alexander's first teachers was Leonidas, a relative of         Olympias, who struggled to control the defiant boy. Philip hired         Leonidas to train the youth in math, archery, and horsemanship (the         training and care of horses). Alexander's favorite tutor was         Lysimachus. This tutor devised a game in which Alexander impersonated         the hero Achilles. Achilles was a heroic Greek warrior from a famous         ancient poem called the Iliad. Achilles became the model of the noble warrior for Alexander, and he         modeled himself after this hero. This game delighted Olympias because         her family claimed the hero as an ancestor.\nIn 343 Philip asked Aristotle (384–322\nB.C.E.\n), the famous Greek philosopher and scientist, to tutor Alexander. For         three years in the rural Macedonian village of Mieza, Aristotle taught         Alexander philosophy, government, politics, poetry, drama, and the         sciences. Aristotle wrote a shortened edition of the Iliad, which Alexander always kept with him.\nBeginnings of the soldier\nAlexander's education at Mieza ended in 340\nB.C.E.\n. While Philip was away fighting a war, he left the sixteen-year-old         prince as acting king. Within a year Alexander led his first military         attack against a rival tribe. In 338 he led the cavalry (troops who         fight battles on horseback) and helped his father smash the forces of         Athens and Thebes, two Greek city-states.\nAlexander's relationship and military cooperation with his father         ended soon after Philip took control of the Corinthian League. The         Corinthian League was a military alliance made up of all the Greek         states except for Sparta. Philip then married another woman, which         forced Alexander and Olympias to flee Macedon. Eventually Philip and         Alexander were reunited.\nAlexander as king\nIn the summer of 336\nB.C.E.\nat the ancient Macedonian capital of Aegai, Alexander's sister         married her uncle Alexander. During this event Philip was assassinated         by a young Macedonian noble, Pausanias. After his father's death         Alexander sought the approval of the Macedonian army for his bid for         kingship. The generals agreed and proclaimed him king, making Alexander         the ruler of Macedon. In order to secure his           throne, Alexander then killed everyone who could have a possible claim         to the kingship.\nAlthough he was the king of Macedon, Alexander did not automatically         gain control of the Corinthian League. Some Greek states rejoiced at         Philip's murder, and Athens wanted to rule the League. Throughout         Greece independence movements arose. Immediately Alexander led his         armies to Greece to stop these movements. The Greek states quickly         recognized him as their leader, while Sparta still refused to join. The         League gave Alexander unlimited military powers to attack Persia, a         large kingdom to the east of Greece.\nAsian campaign\nIn October 335\nB.C.E.\nAlexander returned to Macedon and prepared for his Persian expedition.         In numbers of troops, ships, and wealth, Alexander's resources         were inferior to those of Darius III (380–330\nB.C.E.\n), the king of Persia. In the early spring of 334 Alexander's         army met Darius's army for the first time. Alexander's         army defeated the Persians and continued to move west. Darius's         capital at Sardis fell easily, followed by the cities of Miletus and         Halicarnassus. The territories Alexander conquered formed the         foundations of his Asian empire.\nBy autumn 334 Alexander had crossed the southern coast of Asia Minor         (now Turkey). In Asia Minor, Alexander cut the famous Gordian Knot.         According to tradition, whoever undid the intricate Gordian Knot would         become ruler of Asia. Many people began to believe that Alexander had         godlike powers and was destined to rule Asia.\nThen in 333 Alexander moved his forces east and the two kings met in         battle at the city of Issus. Alexander was outnumbered but used creative         military formations to beat Darius's forces. Darius fled.         Alexander then attacked the Persian royal camp where he gained lots of         riches and captured the royal family. He treated Darius's wife,         mother, and three children with respect. With Darius's army         defeated, Alexander proclaimed himself king of Asia.\nAs a result of the defeat, Darius wanted to sign a truce with Alexander.         He offered a large ransom for his family, a marriage alliance, a treaty         of friendship, and part of his empire. Alexander ignored Darius's         offer because he wanted to conquer all of Asia.\nCampaign in Egypt\nAlexander then pushed on into Egypt. Egypt fell to Alexander without         resistance, and the Egyptians hailed him as their deliverer from Persian         domination. In every country, Alexander respected the local customs,         religions, and citizens. In Egypt he sacrificed to the local gods and         the Egyptian priesthood recognized him as pharaoh, or ruler of ancient         Egypt. They hailed Alexander as a god. Alexander then worked to bring         Greek culture to Egypt. In 331\nB.C.E.\nhe founded the city of Alexandria, which became a center of Greek         culture and commerce.\nMore fighting in Persia\nIn September 331\nB.C.E.\nAlexander defeated the Persians at the Battle of Gaugamela. The Persian         army collapsed, and again Darius fled. Instead of chasing after him,         Alexander explored Babylonia, which was the region that Darius had         abandoned. The land had rich farmlands, palaces, and treasures.         Alexander became \"King of Babylon,           King of Asia, King of the Four Quarters of the World.\"\nAlexander next set out for Persepolis, the capital of the Persian         Empire. To prevent an uprising, Alexander burned Persepolis. In the         spring of 330 he marched to Darius's last capital, Ecbatana         (modern Hamadan). There Alexander set off in pursuit of Darius.\nBy the time Alexander caught up with Darius in July 330, Darius's         assistants had assassinated him. Alexander ordered a royal funeral with         honors for his enemy. As Darius's successor, Alexander captured         the assassins and punished them according to Persian law. Alexander was         now the king of Persia, and he began to wear Persian royal clothing. As         elsewhere, Alexander respected the local customs.\nIran and India\nAfter defeating Darius, Alexander pushed eastward toward Iran. He         conquered the region, built cities, and established colonies of         Macedonians. In the spring of 327\nB.C.E.\nhe seized the fortress of Ariamazes and captured the prince Oxyartes.         Alexander married Oxyartes's daughter Rhoxana to hold together         his Eastern empire more closely in a political alliance.\nIn the summer of 327 Alexander marched toward India. In northern India,         he defeated the armies of King Porus. Impressed with his bravery and         nobility, Alexander allowed Porus to remain king and gained his loyalty.\nBy July 325 the army continued north to the harsh and barren land in the         Persian Gulf. The hardship and death that occurred after arriving         brought disorganization to the army. It was also at this time that         disorder began to spread throughout the empire. Alexander was greatly         concerned with the rule of his empire and the need for soldiers,         officers, and administrators.\nIn order to strengthen the empire, Alexander then made an attempt to         bind the Persian nobility to the Macedonians to create a ruling class.         To accomplish this goal, he ordered eighty of his Macedonian companions         to marry Persian princesses. Alexander, although married to Rhoxana,         married Stateira, a daughter of Darius, to solidify his rule.\nWhen Alexander incorporated thirty thousand Persians into the army, his         soldiers grumbled. Later that summer, when he dismissed his aged and         wounded Macedonian soldiers, the soldiers spoke out against         Alexander's Persian troops and his Persian manners. Alexander         arrested thirteen of their leaders and executed them. He then addressed         the army and reminded his soldiers of their glories and honors. After         three days the Macedonians apologized for their criticism. In a         thanksgiving feast the Persians joined the Macedonians as forces of         Alexander.\nAlexander's death\nIn the spring of 323\nB.C.E.\nAlexander moved to Babylon and made plans to explore the Caspian Sea         and Arabia and then to conquer northern Africa. On June 2 he fell ill,         and he died eleven days later.\nAlexander's empire had been a vast territory ruled by the king         and his assistants. The empire fell apart at his death. The Greek         culture that Alexander introduced in the East had barely developed. In         time, however, the Persian and Greek cultures blended and prospered as a         result of his rule.\nFor More Information\nBriant, Pierre. Alexander the Great. New York: Harry N.

Persian rule in Egypt came to an end with the arrival of Alexander the Great (pictured here). After his death a dynasty of Greek kings would take control of Egypt and would rule for the next three centuries.\nCredit:  Image courtesy Wikimedia, from an ancient mosaic in Pompeii, Italy\nAlexander the Great was a king of Macedonia who conquered an empire that stretched from the Balkans to modern-day Pakistan.\nAlexander was the son of Philip II and Olympias (one of Philip’s seven or eight wives). He was brought up with the belief that he was of divine birth. “From his earliest days, Olympias had encouraged him to believe that he was a descendent of heroes and gods. Nothing he had accomplished would have discouraged this belief,” writes Wellesley College classics professor Guy MacLean Rogers in his book \"Alexander\" (Random House, 2004). “Achilles, Alexander’s model and ancestor, had not even taken Troy …”\nYet, despite his military accomplishments, ancient records say that he failed to win the respect of some his subjects and, furthermore, he had some of the people closest to him murdered.\nThe writer Arrian (A.D. 86-160) notes that at one point after he had conquered part of modern-day Pakistan he came across a sage who said “King Alexander, each man can have only so much land as this on which we are standing. Like the rest of us, you are only human, except that in your restlessness and arrogance you travel so far from home, making trouble for yourself and others. Well, you will soon be dead and will have as much land as will suffice to bury your corpse.”\n(Translation by Pamela Mensch and James Romm, from \"Alexander the Great: Selections from Arrian, Diodorus, Plutarch and Quintus Curtius,\" Hackett Publishing, 2005)\nAlexander the prince\nAlexander was born around July 20, 356 B.C., in Pella, which was the administrative capital of Macedonia. His father was often away, conquering neighboring territories and putting down revolts. Alexander showed great aptitude as a child and one of his tutors was Aristotle, the famous Greek philosopher.\nCambridge University professor Paul Cartledge writes in his book \"Alexander the Great\" (MacMillan, 2004) that, at the age of 16, Philip II decided to leave his son in charge of Macedonia while he was away on campaign. Alexander took advantage of the opportunity by defeating a Thracian people called the Maedi and founding “Alexandroupolis,” a city he named after himself. “One wonders what his father, founder already of a Philippi and a Philippopolis thought about that,” writes Cartledge.\nIndeed, ancient records indicate that the two became estranged later in Alexander’s teenage years and at one point his mother was exiled to Epirus. Philip II was assassinated in 336 B.C. while celebrating the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra. The person who stabbed him was said to have been a former male lover of his named Pausanias. While ancient writers spin an elaborate tale about his motives, modern historians suspect that he may have been part of a larger plot to kill the king, one that may have included Alexander and his mother.\nUpon his father’s death, Alexander moved quickly to consolidate power. He gained the support of the Macedonian army and intimidated the Greek city states that Philip had conquered into accepting his rule. After campaigns in the Balkans and Thrace, Alexander moved against Thebes, a city in Greece that had risen up in rebellion, conquering it in 335 B.C., and had it destroyed.\nWith Greece and the Balkans pacified, he was ready to launch a campaign against the Persian Empire, a campaign his father had planned but, as fate would have it, he would be the one to lead.\nWar with Persia\nAncient accounts say that when Alexander was at war against the Persians and their king Darius III, he often used the Persian invasions of Greece in the 5th century B.C. as an excuse for his actions. Yet, ironically, Alexander often fought Greek mercenaries while campaigning against Darius III. Even more ironically, Sparta , a city which had famously lost its king and 300 warriors in the Battle of Thermopylae during a Persian invasion attempt, also opposed Alexander, going so far as to seek Persian help in their efforts to overthrow him.\nIn a recently published conference paper, Elpida Hadjidaki, the past director of Maritime Antiquities in the Greek Ministry of Culture, points out that Agis III, the king of Sparta, worked with the Persians to fortify a harbor at Phalasarna, in west Crete. Persia gave him money and ships and in return “Agis sent the money and triremes to his brother Agesilaos, directing him to pay the salaries of the crews, and to sail directly to Crete to settle the affairs of the island for the benefit of Sparta,” writes Hadjidaki.  In his excavations he has found that, with Persian support, the Spartans built fortifications and a larger harbor at Phalasarna.\nYet, despite the opposition from the Spartans, Alexander was successful against Persia. The first major battle he won was the “Battle of Granicus,” fought in 334 B.C. in modern-day western Turkey, not far from the ancient city of Troy. During the battle, Arrian wrote that Alexander defeated a force of 20,000 Persian horsemen and an equal number of foot soldiers. He then advanced down the coast of west Turkey, taking cities and trying to deprive the Persian navy of bases.\nThe second key battle he won, and perhaps the most important, was the Battle of Issus, fought in 333 B.C. near the ancient town of Issus in southern Turkey, close to modern-day Syria. In that battle, the Persians were led by Darius III himself. Arrian estimates that Darius had a force of 600,000 troops (probably wildly exaggerated) and positioned himself initially on a great plain where he could mass them all effectively against Alexander, who hesitated to give battle.\nDarius III is said to have thought this a sign of timidity. “One courtier after another incited Darius, declaring that he would trample down the Macedonian army with his cavalry.” So, Darius gave up his position and chased Alexander. At first this went well, and he actually got in the rear of Alexander’s force. However, when Alexander gave the Persian king battle, it turned out Darius had been led to a narrow spot where the Persians could not use their superior numbers effectively.\nArrian wrote that, against the experienced Macedonian troops, Darius’s left wing was “routed” almost immediately. The toughest opposition actually came from a Greek mercenary force fighting for Darius. Positioned in the center the “action there was desperate, as the Greeks tried to drive the Macedonians back to the river and to recover victory for their own men who were already fleeing,” Arrian wrote. Eventually Darius III fled, along with his army.\nIn his haste, Darius III left much of his family behind including his mother, wife, infant son and two daughters. Alexander ordered that they be “honored, and addressed as royalty,” Arrian wrote. After the battle, Darius III offered Alexander a ransom for his family and alliance, through marriage, with him.\nArrian said that Alexander rebuked Darius in writing and used the attempts of his predecessors to invade Greece as justification for his campaign against him. He also added that “in the future whenever you send word to me, address yourself to me as King of Asia and not as an equal, and let me know, as the master of all that belonged to you, if you have need of anything.” \nInto Egypt\nAlexander moved south along the eastern Mediterranean, a strategy designed, again, to deprive the Persians of their naval bases. Many cities surrendered while some, such as Tyre , which was on an island, put up a fight and forced Alexander to lay siege.\nIn 332 B.C., after Gaza was taken by siege, Alexander entered Egypt, a country that had experienced on-and-off periods of Persian rule for two centuries. On its northern coast, he founded Alexandria, the most successful city he ever built. Arrian wrote that “a sudden passion for the project seized him, and he himself marked out where the agora was to be built and decided how many temples were to be erected and to which gods they were to be dedicated…” Recent research indicates that Alexandria may have been built to face the rising sun on the day Alexander was born.\nHe also travelled to Libya to see the oracle of Ammon. Traveling through unmarked desert, his party made his way to the temple and Alexander is said to have consulted the oracle in private.\nFinal battle with Darius III\nWith the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt secured, the Persians were deprived of naval bases, and Alexander was free to move inland to conquer the eastern half of the Persian Empire.\nAt the Battle of Gaugamela, fought in 331 B.C. in northern Iraq near present-day Erbil, Alexander is said by ancient sources to have faced as many as 1 million troops (again probably grossly exaggerated). Darius III brought soldiers from all over, and even beyond, his empire. Scythian horsemen from his northern borders faced Alexander, as did “Indian” troops (as the ancient writers called them) who were probably from modern-day Pakistan.\nAgain, in a bid to stymie Darius III’s superior numbers, Alexander moved his troops toward unlevel ground. Darius sent his cavalry after them and Alexander countered with his. His horsemen, while taking heavy losses, held their own. Darius responded by sending his chariots against Alexander’s phalanx infantry, a bad move, as they were cut to pieces by javelins.\nThe battle soon became a war of nerves. “For a brief period the fighting was hand to hand, but when Alexander and his horseman pressed the enemy hard, shoving the Persians and striking their faces with spears, and the Macedonian phalanx, tightly arrayed and bristling with pikes, was already upon them, Darius, who had long been in a state of dread, now saw terrors all around him; he wheeled about — the first to do so — and fled,” wrote Arrian. From that point on the Persian army started to collapse and the Persian king fled with Alexander in hot pursuit.\nDarius III would flee into the eastern part of his empire, hoping to rally enough soldiers for another battle. Betrayed by one his satraps named Bessus (who claimed kingship over what was left of Persia), Darius was captured by his own troops and killed.\nAlexander was saddened when he found his dead body. “Alexander sent Darius’ body back to Persepolis and ordered that he be buried, like all his royal predecessors, in the royal tombs,” Arrian wrote.\nAlexander pursued Bessus eastward until he was caught and killed. Then, wishing to incorporate the most easterly portions of the Persian Empire into his own, he campaigned in central Asia. It was a rocky, frost-bitten campaign, which raised tensions within his own army and, ultimately, would lead to Alexander killing two of his closest friends.\nThe killing of Parmerio\nThe killing of Parmerio, his former second in command, and Cleitus, a close friend of the king who is said to have saved his life at the Battle of Granicus, may be seen as a sign of how his men were becoming tired of campaigning, and how Alexander was becoming more paranoid.\nAt some point during Alexander’s campaign in central Asia, Parmerio’s son, Philotas, allegedly failed to report a plot against Alexander’s life. The king, incensed, decided to kill not only Philotas and the other men deemed conspirators, but also Parmerio, even though he apparently had nothing to do with the alleged plot.\nAccording to the writer Quintus Curtius (who lived during the first century A.D.), Alexander tasked a man named Polydamus, a friend of Parmerio, to perform the deed, holding his brothers hostage until he murdered him. Arriving in Parmerio’s tent in the city where he was stationed, he handed him a letter from Alexander and one marked as being from his son.\nWhen he was reading the letter from his son, a general named Cleander, who aided Polydamus with his mission, “opened him (Parmerio) up with a sword thrust to his side, then struck him a second blow in the throat…” killing him. (Translation by Pamela Mensch and James Romm)\nMurder of Cleitus\nA second casualty of Alexander’s was his old friend Cleitus, who was angry that Alexander was adopting Persian dress and customs. After an episode where the two were drinking, Cleitus told his king off, telling him, in essence, that he should follow Macedonian ways, not those of the Persians who had opposed him.\nAfter the two got drunk, Cleitus lifted up his right hand and said “this is the hand, Alexander, that saved you then (at the Battle of Granicus).” Alexander, infuriated, killed him with a spear or pike.\nAlexander took his act of murder terribly. “Again and again, he called himself his friend’s murderer and went without food and drink for three days and completely neglected his person,” wrote Arrian.\nAn 1875 map shows Alexander the Great's empire."

    "content": "Alexander's Self-Deification - Livius\n \nAlexander's Self-Deification\nAlexander the Great (*356; r. 336-323): the  Macedonian  king who defeated his Persian colleague  Darius III Codomannus  and conquered the  Achaemenid Empire . During his campaigns, Alexander visited a.o. Egypt,  Babylonia , Persis,  Media ,  Bactria , the  Punjab , and the valley of the  Indus . In the second half of his reign, he had to find a way to rule his newly conquered countries. Therefore, he made  Babylon  his capital and introduced the oriental court ceremonial, which caused great tensions with his Macedonian and Greek officers.\nOverview\nAlexander as kosmokrator, \"ruler of the universe\"\nAlthough Alexander the Great was not the first human to receive divine honors, his self-deification set an example for Hellenistic kings, Roman emperors, and other rulers. However, this would not have been the case if Alexander’s self-deification had not been entirely rational and if it had not offered advantages that no ancient ruler could afford to ignore.\nAlexander's Example: Philip\nThe Macedonians had wanted to attack the Achaemenid Empire since 340 BCE, but their king Philip had first decided to teach the Greeks that their defeat in the Third Sacred War (356-346) had been decisive. He acted quickly. In 338, he defeated the Athenians and Thebans at Chaeronea ; in 337, he reorganized Greece in the Corinthian League ; and in the spring of 336, when the Persian Empire was suffering from a civil war, his advance guard crossed the Hellespont . Several towns in Asia Minor revolted and hailed Philip, who was still in Macedonia, as their liberator.\nPhilip II\nThe people of Eresus (a town on the island Lesbos) erected an altar to Zeus Philippios and Ephesians placed his statue in the sanctuary of Artemis. Now that he shared a shrine with a deity - the Greek word is synnaos - Philip had been raised to a rank higher than that of a mere mortal, but even better was to come. In October 336, the Macedonian king wanted to celebrate the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra and his departure to the Persian front. Those who attended the ceremony in the theater of Aegae saw that statues of the twelve Olympian deities had been placed on the stage, and that Philip wanted to sit on a throne between them. He wanted to be the equal of the gods, isotheos.\nIt was not to be. Philip was murdered during the celebration (by a bodyguard, for personal reasons), and many Greeks and Macedonians must have believed that this was the fitting punishment of the blasphemer. Yet, he had set an example for Alexander, whose spectacular career was to be matched by an equally spectacular rise in the cosmic hierarchy: crown prince, king of Macedonia, king of Asia, son of Zeus, justice incarnated, avatar of Vishnu, invincible god.\nKing of Asia\nAs is well-known, Alexander invaded Asia in 334, defeated a force of satraps - Persia’s royal army force was still suppressing revolts in Babylonia and Egypt - at a small river called Granicus , and proceeded to capture towns that were, after the destruction of the Persian forces at the Granicus, undergarrisoned. After losing the strategic initiative during the time-consuming siege of Halicarnassus , the Macedonian armies united at Gordium , where they were forced to wait for the next move by their enemies: would they continue the naval offensive in the west or would they gather an army in Syria? During this pause, Alexander visited a shrine where an old chariot was standing. According to an ancient oracle, the man who was able to untie the knot with which a yoke was tied to the chariot would one day be “king of Asia”. The way Alexander solved the problem, by cutting the knot , has become proverbal.\nThe original, native myth behind the prediction cannot have been about kingship of Asia. “Asia” is of course not an Asian concept: the idea that there existed something called Asia originated on the shores of the Aegean Sea, where Europe and Asia are recognizable entities. And even if “Asia” would have been a concept known to the people of Gordium, what would that have meant to the Macedonians and Greeks? Was Asia the name only of the eastern shore of Aegean Sea? Was it all the land until the Euphrates? A synonym for the Persian Empire? The entire continent? No one knew, and that made the prediction perfectly suitable as propaganda. At any given moment, and no matter where the Persians decided to attack, Alexander could claim victory.\nAs it happened, the new Persian king, Darius III Codomannus , recalled his troops from the Aegean Sea to Syria, and Alexander marched to the southeast, where he defeated the Persian main force at Issus (November 333). The road to the Persian ports in Phoenicia lay open, and it was certain that most cities would eventually come to terms with the Macedonians. Alexander could rightfully claim to be “king of Asia”, and although his biographer Plutarch - who is not interested in chronology - states that the young Macedonian ruler accepted this title only after his victory at Gaugamela , the historian Arrian is probably right that it happened immediately after Issus.\nFoundation inscription of the temple of Athena Polias in Priene\nAt that point, Alexander also started to use the expression basileus, “king”, in inscriptions (e.g., the foundation inscription of the temple of Athena Polias in Priene). Anyhow, it was after a military victory that Alexander started to call himself “king of Asia”. It was his first step towards divinity.\nSon of Zeus\nAfter the conquest of Phoenicia, where Alexander left several garrisons, he proceeded to Egypt. His motives are not entirely clear, but control of one of the main grain suppliers of Greece was useful, because the Greek towns had not been fully pacified. However this may be, the move meant an expansion of the war and required a larger army. We read about reinforcements by contingents from several subject nations, like the Samarians , and we also read about non-Macedonian and non-Greek officials, like the Egyptian Petisis, who was left in charge of Lower Egypt. Alexander’s army and kingdom were becoming increasingly complex.\nAlexander (R) as pharaoh\nIn Egypt, Alexander tried to present himself as a local ruler, for example by sacrificing to the Apis bull , a ritual that the Greeks believed to be important for the Egyptians. Among the royal titles accepted by Alexander were ancient names like “beloved by Amun” and “chosen by Ra”. The important point, however, was the common pharaonic title “son of Ra”, which might be translated as both “son of Zeus” (because Ra was Egypt’s supreme god) and “son of Helios” (because Ra was a solar deity). Both must have appealed to Alexander, who belonged to a dynasty that claimed to descend from Zeus’ son Heracles, and was somehow connected to the sun as well (see below ).\nThe title of “son of Zeus” was immediately accepted in the Greek world. While Alexander was venturing in the western desert, where the priest of the oracle of Ammon in Siwa again saluted him as son of a god, reports about Alexander’s new title must have been carried to Greece on the last ships to cross the Mediterranean before the winter set in. When the sea was open again in the spring of 331, the first ships to arrive in Egypt brought the news that the old oracle of Didyma , which had been silent since the age of Xerxes , had spoken again, and had “unexpectedly” announced that Alexander was the son of Zeus.\nIt is easy to be cynical about this. To Alexander, who seriously believed to be a descendant of Heracles and Achilles, it was a fact of life that mere mortals could have divine fathers. Besides, the Macedonian soldiers were already far from home, the outcome of the war was still uncertain, and the treasuries of Susa and Persepolis still had to be captured. Accepting glorious titles was a way to inspire the men. There was more to come, because Alexander’s army became increasingly complex - the ruler cult was to be an important way to keep it united.\nSogdia\nAt the Euphrates , the Persian army managed to block Alexander’s march to Babylon , forcing him to make a detour along the Tigris . It was the last Persian success. At Gaugamela, the Macedonians and their allies defeated their opponents, who were demoralized by a celestial omen. Alexander captured and garrisoned Babylon and Susa, fought himself a way through the Zagros mountains , reached the Persian capital Persepolis, and sacked it. In July 330, Darius III was killed by his own satraps , and while the murderers fled to Sogdia (modern Uzbekistan), the son of Zeus faced the strategic dilemma that had been in the making for some time: if he returned home, an Iranian leader might reunite the Iranian tribes and become dangerous again (as the Parthian king Mithradates I the Great was to do in the 140s), if Alexander stayed in Iran, however, he needed more garrisons than Macedonia and Greece could send.\nHe chose the second course, which inevitably meant that he would have to strike a compromise with the defeated Persians: they would have to be the Macedonians’ partners. This created tensions with more conservative people in Alexander’s army. Many soldiers wanted to go back, but instead, they had to invade Sogdia - an operation that was only necessary to appease the Persians, who wanted to see the murderers of their king punished. The frustrated soldiers must have felt even worse when they learned that their commander had started to dress like a Persian king. The problems were exacerbated when the Macedonian infantry forces suffered defeats and the Iranian cavalry achieved successes.\nProskynesis, the Persian ritual salutation\nTensions between the European and the Asian units, tensions between the Macedonian veterans and newly arrived Greek mercenaries, tensions between cavalry and infantry: more than ever, Alexander needed a unifying principle. The perfect solution was to introduce proskynesis , the Persian court ritual in which every nation and rank had a way of its own to approach the ruler.\nWe cannot reconstruct the details, but perhaps non-soldiers were to prostrate themselves, soldiers were to bow, and the highest (Macedonian) officers were to blow a kiss. The introduction was carefully staged and the Iranian officers saluted the new great king as they were used to, but when a courtier made a joke about what was going on, this attempt to unite court and army in one ritual came to naught. Alexander’s anger is best proven by the fact that no one in the camp ever discovered what became of the courtier.\nThe Iranian court ritual was so offensive because the Greeks were not used to bow - they only bowed for their gods. So, if Alexander wanted to give a sense of shared values to his army, he had to become a god.\nAs it happened, there was a second incident that brought Alexander to the same conclusion. During a banquet, when Alexander was drunk, he killed one of his friends. Immediately, he announced he would commit suicide, which would no doubt result in the violent disintegration of the army. Anyone agreed that this had to be avoided at all costs, and a philosopher convinced the son of Zeus that he had done nothing wrong. After all, he was a king and kings made laws, hence kings were above the law, and anything was allowed if it was done by a king, as if he were justice incarnated.\nRainmaker\nAfter the genocidal campaign in Sogdia had ended, the Macedonians invaded the Punjab. Somewhere in the valley of the river  Kabul , a group of frightened rajas came to Alexander, saying that they had heard stories about visiting gods, but had never seen a deity themselves, which was why they had come to submit themselves to Alexander. It is hard to reconstruct what lies behind this incident, but it is likely that the Indian leaders recognized the conqueror as avatar of Vishnu. However that may be, they were the first to recognize Alexander as the god he believed he needed to be.\nAssuming that all of India had now surrendered, Alexander invaded the Punjab, mercilessly killing anyone who resisted. The main battle was fought in the spring of 326 against the leader of the kingdom of the Paurava, who is usually called Porus in the Greek sources. The battle was won because during a devastating rainshower, the Indian leader could not employ his main weapons: his chariots and elephants slipped away in the mud, the archers could not fix their three-meter tall bows on solid ground. Immediately after the fight, Alexander issued a new set of coins, showing himself with a lightning bolt in his hand. In other words, the official battle theology was that Alexander had caused the rain to fall, an idea that fitted perfectly in both Iranian ideas about kingship and Macedonian ideas that Alexander was the son of the cloud-gathering Zeus.\nDid the soldiers believe it? Perhaps not: they refused to invade the kingdom of Magadha along the Ganges, forcing Alexander to return.\nAn incident during the return campaign shows how Alexander tried to deify himself: when he was in fact wounded in his sternum (as Nearchus tells us), he pretended to have a pneumothorax (as the sources have recorded). His soldiers, who knew that a pneumothorax was incurable, must have been impressed when Alexander managed to ride a horse after a surprisingly brief time. This incident also suggests that the Macedonian king himself did not believe that he was a god. It was only necessary to unify his army.\nThe invincible god\nAlexander as Heracles\nA request to sacrifice to Alexander is not attested, but there are strong indications that by the end of 324 BCE, the king received divine honors. He had already presented himself as Dionysus, and if we are to believe Ephippus (one of his courtiers), Alexander also wore the attributes of Heracles occasionally. It was an act, and he still hoped to persuade the Macedonian part of his army to join: if he pretended to be their god, they could pretend that they worshiped him, and they would have a unified army, court, and state.\nThe Greek towns were certainly willing to join. The Ephesians invented a nice story about Alexander’s miraculous birth and hired a famous artist to make a painting of Alexander with his lightning bolt; in Priene , the house where Alexander had once spent a couple of nights, became a temple; and in Athens, an altar was dedicated to “the invincible god”.\nBy 323, Alexander seemed to have achieved his aim, and it is possible to read the story about the “ Opis Mutiny ” not as a mutiny, but as an account of Alexander’s last victory: his own men looking for a way to accept the Iranian court ritual. We don’t know, but it is certain that kneeling and kissing were common at the court of Alexander’s successors.\nAlexander died, on June 11, 323 in Babylon while preparing for a campaign to Arabia . One anecdote, recorded by Arrian, tells that the king at some stage wanted to drown himself in the Euphrates, so that his body would be lost and people would believe that he ascended to heaven. The story is of course untrue, but fits his general aims.\nAlexander as sun god\nThe self-deification had been a rational policy, and was repeated by his successors: the ruler cult of the Hellenistic kings and Roman emperors is well-attested. It was a strategy for anyone who had to create unity in the armies, courts, and kingdoms. But it came at a prize: during the Roman Empire, it was generally recognized that Alexander’s idea that the god-king was not subject to the law, was the equivalent of moral corruption. The man who had conquered the world, had lost his soul. It is possible that the famous remark, made by Vespasian on his death bed, that he feared becoming a god, was not a joke at all, but a serious observation about the corruptive nature of power.\nLiterature\nThis article was published in 2010 in Ancient Warfare . The importance of the events in Sogdia and India is dealt with by A.B. Bosworth in his Alexander and the East. The Tragedy of Triumph (1998). The interpretation of the coins discussed above is based on Frank Holt, Alexander the Great and the Mystery of the Elephant Medallions (2003).\nAppendix: The Sun King\nThe \"sun of Vergina\"\nHerodotus tells an old, rationalized legend about Macedonia’s first king and his connection to the sun.note[Histories 8.137.] We would like to know more about it, because on many occasions, Alexander is connected to the sun as well: he compares himself to a sunnote[ Diodorus , World History 17.54.5.] and is upset when he faces the setting sun.note[ Appian , Civil Wars 2.153.] Later artists had no problems in equaling the Macedonian conqueror to Helios, and although this may be a reconsideration of the fact that Alexander, like the sun, had seen the who world, it is equally possible that the association was already in existence during Alexander’s life.\nIt may be noted that the closest iconographic parallel to the sixteen-pointed symbol that is now known as the “star of Vergina”, is the sun as shown on the coins of Ouranopolis, a new city, founded by Cassander’s brother Alexarchus, surnamed “the sun”.\nThis page was created in 2004; last modified on 17 January 2017."

Already in his lifetime the subject of fabulous stories, he later became the hero of a full-scale legend bearing only the sketchiest resemblance to his historical career.\nAlexander the Great, detail from Alexander and Porus, painting by …\n© Photos.com/Jupiterimages\nLife\nHe was born in 356 bce at Pella in Macedonia, the son of Philip II and Olympias (daughter of King Neoptolemus of Epirus ). From age 13 to 16 he was taught by Aristotle , who inspired him with an interest in philosophy , medicine , and scientific investigation , but he was later to advance beyond his teacher’s narrow precept that non-Greeks should be treated as slaves. Left in charge of Macedonia in 340 during Philip’s attack on Byzantium, Alexander defeated the Maedi, a Thracian people. Two years later he commanded the left wing at the Battle of Chaeronea , in which Philip defeated the allied Greek states, and displayed personal courage in breaking the Sacred Band of Thebes , an elite military corps composed of 150 pairs of lovers. A year later Philip divorced Olympias, and, after a quarrel at a feast held to celebrate his father’s new marriage, Alexander and his mother fled to Epirus, and Alexander later went to Illyria . Shortly afterward, father and son were reconciled and Alexander returned, but his position as heir was jeopardized.\nancient Greek civilization: Alexander the Great\nIn 336, however, on Philip’s assassination, Alexander, acclaimed by the army, succeeded without opposition. He at once executed the princes of Lyncestis, alleged to be behind Philip’s murder, along with all possible rivals and the whole of the faction opposed to him. He then marched south, recovered a wavering Thessaly , and at an assembly of the Greek League of Corinth was appointed generalissimo for the forthcoming invasion of Asia , already planned and initiated by Philip. Returning to Macedonia by way of Delphi (where the Pythian priestess acclaimed him “invincible”), he advanced into Thrace in spring 335 and, after forcing the Shipka Pass and crushing the Triballi , crossed the Danube to disperse the Getae ; turning west, he then defeated and shattered a coalition of Illyrians who had invaded Macedonia. Meanwhile, a rumour of his death had precipitated a revolt of Theban democrats; other Greek states favoured Thebes , and the Athenians , urged on by Demosthenes , voted help. In 14 days Alexander marched 240 miles from Pelion (near modern Korçë , Albania ) in Illyria to Thebes. When the Thebans refused to surrender, he made an entry and razed their city to the ground, sparing only temples and Pindar ’s house; 6,000 were killed and all survivors sold into slavery . The other Greek states were cowed by this severity, and Alexander could afford to treat Athens leniently. Macedonian garrisons were left in Corinth , Chalcis , and the Cadmea (the citadel of Thebes).\nBeginnings of the Persian expedition\nBritannica Stories\nEyjafjallajökull volcano\nWhile the siege of Tyre was in progress, Darius sent a new offer: he would pay a huge ransom of 10,000 talents for his family and cede all his lands west of the Euphrates . “I would accept,” Parmenio is reported to have said, “were I Alexander”; “I too,” was the famous retort, “were I Parmenio.” The storming of Tyre in July 332 was Alexander’s greatest military achievement; it was attended with great carnage and the sale of the women and children into slavery . Leaving Parmenio in Syria, Alexander advanced south without opposition until he reached Gaza on its high mound; there bitter resistance halted him for two months, and he sustained a serious shoulder wound during a sortie. There is no basis for the tradition that he turned aside to visit Jerusalem .\nIn November 332 he reached Egypt . The people welcomed him as their deliverer, and the Persian satrap Mazaces wisely surrendered. At Memphis Alexander sacrificed to Apis , the Greek term for Hapi, the sacred Egyptian bull, and was crowned with the traditional double crown of the pharaohs ; the native priests were placated and their religion encouraged. He spent the winter organizing Egypt , where he employed Egyptian governors, keeping the army under a separate Macedonian command. He founded the city of Alexandria near the western arm of the Nile on a fine site between the sea and Lake Mareotis, protected by the island of Pharos, and had it laid out by the Rhodian architect Deinocrates. He is also said to have sent an expedition to discover the causes of the flooding of the Nile. From Alexandria he marched along the coast to Paraetonium and from there inland to visit the celebrated oracle of the god Amon (at Sīwah ); the difficult journey was later embroidered with flattering legends . On his reaching the oracle in its oasis , the priest gave him the traditional salutation of a pharaoh, as son of Amon; Alexander consulted the god on the success of his expedition but revealed the reply to no one. Later the incident was to contribute to the story that he was the son of Zeus and, thus, to his “deification.” In spring 331 he returned to Tyre, appointed a Macedonian satrap for Syria, and prepared to advance into Mesopotamia . His conquest of Egypt had completed his control of the whole eastern Mediterranean coast.\nIn July 331 Alexander was at Thapsacus on the Euphrates . Instead of taking the direct route down the river to Babylon , he made across northern Mesopotamia toward the Tigris , and Darius, learning of this move from an advance force sent under Mazaeus to the Euphrates crossing, marched up the Tigris to oppose him. The decisive battle of the war was fought on October 31, on the plain of Gaugamela between Nineveh and Arbela. Alexander pursued the defeated Persian forces for 35 miles to Arbela, but Darius escaped with his Bactrian cavalry and Greek mercenaries into Media .\nAlexander now occupied Babylon , city and province; Mazaeus, who surrendered it, was confirmed as satrap in conjunction with a Macedonian troop commander, and quite exceptionally was granted the right to coin . As in Egypt, the local priesthood was encouraged. Susa , the capital, also surrendered, releasing huge treasures amounting to 50,000 gold talents; here Alexander established Darius’s family in comfort. Crushing the mountain tribe of the Ouxians, he now pressed on over the Zagros range into Persia proper and, successfully turning the Pass of the Persian Gates, held by the satrap Ariobarzanes , he entered Persepolis and Pasargadae . At Persepolis he ceremonially burned down the palace of Xerxes , as a symbol that the Panhellenic war of revenge was at an end; for such seems the probable significance of an act that tradition later explained as a drunken frolic inspired by Thaïs , an Athenian courtesan. In spring 330 Alexander marched north into Media and occupied its capital. The Thessalians and Greek allies were sent home; henceforward he was waging a purely personal war.\nAs Mazaeus’s appointment indicated, Alexander’s views on the empire were changing. He had come to envisage a joint ruling people consisting of Macedonians and Persians, and this served to augment the misunderstanding that now arose between him and his people. Before continuing his pursuit of Darius, who had retreated into Bactria , he assembled all the Persian treasure and entrusted it to Harpalus , who was to hold it at Ecbatana as chief treasurer. Parmenio was also left behind in Media to control communications; the presence of this older man had perhaps become irksome.\nIn midsummer 330 Alexander set out for the eastern provinces at a high speed via Rhagae (modern Rayy , near Tehrān ) and the Caspian Gates, where he learned that Bessus , the satrap of Bactria, had deposed Darius. After a skirmish near modern Shāhrūd, the usurper had Darius stabbed and left him to die. Alexander sent his body for burial with due honours in the royal tombs at Persepolis.\nCampaign eastward to Central Asia\nDarius ’s death left no obstacle to Alexander’s claim to be Great King, and a Rhodian inscription of this year (330) calls him “lord of Asia”—i.e., of the Persian empire; soon afterward his Asian coins carry the title of king. Crossing the Elburz Mountains to the Caspian , he seized Zadracarta in Hyrcania and received the submission of a group of satraps and Persian notables, some of whom he confirmed in their offices; in a diversion westward, perhaps to modern Āmol , he reduced the Mardi, a mountain people who inhabited the Elburz Mountains. He also accepted the surrender of Darius’s Greek mercenaries. His advance eastward was now rapid. In Aria he reduced Satibarzanes, who had offered submission only to revolt, and he founded Alexandria of the Arians (modern Herāt ). At Phrada in Drangiana (either near modern Nad-e ʿAli in Seistan or farther north at Farah ), he at last took steps to destroy Parmenio and his family. Philotas , Parmenio’s son, commander of the elite Companion cavalry, was implicated in an alleged plot against Alexander’s life, condemned by the army, and executed; and a secret message was sent to Cleander , Parmenio’s second in command, who obediently assassinated him. This ruthless action excited widespread horror but strengthened Alexander’s position relative to his critics and those whom he regarded as his father’s men. All Parmenio’s adherents were now eliminated and men close to Alexander promoted. The Companion cavalry was reorganized in two sections, each containing four squadrons (now known as hipparchies); one group was commanded by Alexander’s oldest friend, Hephaestion , the other by Cleitus , an older man. From Phrada, Alexander pressed on during the winter of 330–329 up the valley of the Helmand River , through Arachosia , and over the mountains past the site of modern Kābul into the country of the Paropamisadae, where he founded Alexandria by the Caucasus .\nBessus was now in Bactria raising a national revolt in the eastern satrapies with the usurped title of Great King. Crossing the Hindu Kush northward over the Khawak Pass (11,650 feet [3,550 metres]), Alexander brought his army, despite food shortages, to Drapsaca (sometimes identified with modern Banu [Andarab], probably farther north at Qunduz); outflanked, Bessus fled beyond the Oxus (modern Amu Darya ), and Alexander, marching west to Bactra-Zariaspa (modern Balkh [ Wazirabad ] in Afghanistan ), appointed loyal satraps in Bactria and Aria. Crossing the Oxus, he sent his general Ptolemy in pursuit of Bessus, who had meanwhile been overthrown by the Sogdian Spitamenes. Bessus was captured, flogged, and sent to Bactra, where he was later mutilated after the Persian manner (losing his nose and ears); in due course he was publicly executed at Ecbatana .\nFrom Maracanda (modern Samarkand ) Alexander advanced by way of Cyropolis to the Jaxartes (modern Syrdarya), the boundary of the Persian empire. There he broke the opposition of the Scythian nomads by his use of catapults and, after defeating them in a battle on the north bank of the river, pursued them into the interior. On the site of modern Leninabad ( Khojent ) on the Jaxartes, he founded a city, Alexandria Eschate, “the farthest.” Meanwhile, Spitamenes had raised all Sogdiana in revolt behind him, bringing in the Massagetai , a people of the Shaka confederacy. It took Alexander until the autumn of 328 to crush the most determined opponent he encountered in his campaigns. Later in the same year he attacked Oxyartes and the remaining barons who held out in the hills of Paraetacene (modern Tajikistan ); volunteers seized the crag on which Oxyartes had his stronghold, and among the captives was his daughter, Roxana . In reconciliation Alexander married her, and the rest of his opponents were either won over or crushed.\nAn incident that occurred at Maracanda widened the breach between Alexander and many of his Macedonians. He murdered Cleitus, one of his most-trusted commanders, in a drunken quarrel, but his excessive display of remorse led the army to pass a decree convicting Cleitus posthumously of treason . The event marked a step in Alexander’s progress toward Eastern absolutism, and this growing attitude found its outward expression in his use of Persian royal dress. Shortly afterward, at Bactra , he attempted to impose the Persian court ceremonial, involving prostration (proskynesis), on the Greeks and Macedonians too, but to them this custom, habitual for Persians entering the king’s presence, implied an act of worship and was intolerable before a human. Even Callisthenes , historian and nephew of Aristotle , whose ostentatious flattery had perhaps encouraged Alexander to see himself in the role of a god, refused to abase himself. Macedonian laughter caused the experiment to founder, and Alexander abandoned it. Shortly afterward, however, Callisthenes was held to be privy to a conspiracy among the royal pages and was executed (or died in prison; accounts vary); resentment of this action alienated sympathy from Alexander within the Peripatetic school of philosophers, with which Callisthenes had close connections.\nInvasion of India\nIn early summer 327 Alexander left Bactria with a reinforced army under a reorganized command. If Plutarch ’s figure of 120,000 men has any reality, however, it must include all kinds of auxiliary services, together with muleteers, camel drivers, medical corps, peddlers, entertainers, women, and children; the fighting strength perhaps stood at about 35,000. Recrossing the Hindu Kush , probably by Bamiyan and the Ghorband Valley, Alexander divided his forces. Half the army with the baggage under Hephaestion and Perdiccas , both cavalry commanders, was sent through the Khyber Pass , while he himself led the rest, together with his siege train, through the hills to the north. His advance through Swāt and Gandhāra was marked by the storming of the almost impregnable pinnacle of Aornos , the modern Pir-Sar, a few miles west of the Indus and north of the Buner River, an impressive feat of siegecraft. In spring 326, crossing the Indus near Attock, Alexander entered Taxila , whose ruler, Taxiles, furnished elephants and troops in return for aid against his rival Porus , who ruled the lands between the Hydaspes (modern Jhelum ) and the Acesines (modern Chenāb ). In June Alexander fought his last great battle on the left bank of the Hydaspes . He founded two cities there, Alexandria Nicaea (to celebrate his victory) and Bucephala (named after his horse Bucephalus , which died there); and Porus became his ally.\nHow much Alexander knew of India beyond the Hyphasis (probably the modern Beas ) is uncertain; there is no conclusive proof that he had heard of the Ganges . But he was anxious to press on farther, and he had advanced to the Hyphasis when his army mutinied, refusing to go farther in the tropical rain; they were weary in body and spirit, and Coenus, one of Alexander’s four chief marshals, acted as their spokesman. On finding the army adamant , Alexander agreed to turn back.\nOn the Hyphasis he erected 12 altars to the 12 Olympian gods, and on the Hydaspes he built a fleet of 800 to 1,000 ships. Leaving Porus, he then proceeded down the river and into the Indus, with half his forces on shipboard and half marching in three columns down the two banks. The fleet was commanded by Nearchus , and Alexander’s own captain was Onesicritus; both later wrote accounts of the campaign. The march was attended with much fighting and heavy, pitiless slaughter; at the storming of one town of the Malli near the Hydraotes ( Ravi ) River, Alexander received a severe wound which left him weakened.\nOn reaching Patala, located at the head of the Indus delta, he built a harbour and docks and explored both arms of the Indus, which probably then ran into the Rann of Kachchh . He planned to lead part of his forces back by land, while the rest in perhaps 100 to 150 ships under the command of Nearchus, a Cretan with naval experience, made a voyage of exploration along the Persian Gulf . Local opposition led Nearchus to set sail in September (325), and he was held up for three weeks until he could pick up the northeast monsoon in late October. In September Alexander too set out along the coast through Gedrosia (modern Baluchistan), but he was soon compelled by mountainous country to turn inland, thus failing in his project to establish food depots for the fleet. Craterus , a high-ranking officer, already had been sent off with the baggage and siege train, the elephants, and the sick and wounded, together with three battalions of the phalanx , by way of the Mulla Pass, Quetta , and Kandahar into the Helmand Valley ; from there he was to march through Drangiana to rejoin the main army on the Amanis (modern Minab) River in Carmania. Alexander’s march through Gedrosia proved disastrous; waterless desert and shortage of food and fuel caused great suffering, and many, especially women and children, perished in a sudden monsoon flood while encamped in a wadi. At length, at the Amanis, he was rejoined by Nearchus and the fleet, which also had suffered losses.\nConsolidation of the empire\nAlexander now proceeded farther with the policy of replacing senior officials and executing defaulting governors on which he had already embarked before leaving India. Between 326 and 324 over a third of his satraps were superseded and six were put to death, including the Persian satraps of Persis , Susiana, Carmania, and Paraetacene; three generals in Media , including Cleander , the brother of Coenus (who had died a little earlier), were accused of extortion and summoned to Carmania, where they were arrested, tried, and executed. How far the rigour that from now onward Alexander displayed against his governors represents exemplary punishment for gross maladministration during his absence and how far the elimination of men he had come to distrust (as in the case of Philotas and Parmenio ) is debatable; but the ancient sources generally favourable to him comment adversely on his severity.\nAlexander the Great’s conquests freed the West from the menace of Persian rule and spread Greek …\nEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\nIn spring 324 he was back in Susa , capital of Elam and administrative centre of the Persian empire; the story of his journey through Carmania in a drunken revel, dressed as Dionysus , is embroidered, if not wholly apocryphal. He found that his treasurer, Harpalus , evidently fearing punishment for peculation, had absconded with 6,000 mercenaries and 5,000 talents to Greece; arrested in Athens , he escaped and later was murdered in Crete . At Susa Alexander held a feast to celebrate the seizure of the Persian empire, at which, in furtherance of his policy of fusing Macedonians and Persians into one master race, he and 80 of his officers took Persian wives; he and Hephaestion married Darius ’s daughters Barsine (also called Stateira) and Drypetis, respectively, and 10,000 of his soldiers with native wives were given generous dowries.\nThis policy of racial fusion brought increasing friction to Alexander’s relations with his Macedonians, who had no sympathy for his changed concept of the empire. His determination to incorporate Persians on equal terms in the army and the administration of the provinces was bitterly resented. This discontent was now fanned by the arrival of 30,000 native youths who had received a Macedonian military training and by the introduction of Asian peoples from Bactria , Sogdiana , Arachosia , and other parts of the empire into the Companion cavalry ; whether Asians had previously served with the Companions is uncertain, but if so they must have formed separate squadrons. In addition, Persian nobles had been accepted into the royal cavalry bodyguard. Peucestas, the new governor of Persis , gave this policy full support to flatter Alexander; but most Macedonians saw it as a threat to their own privileged position.\nThe issue came to a head at Opis (324), when Alexander’s decision to send home Macedonian veterans under Craterus was interpreted as a move toward transferring the seat of power to Asia. There was an open mutiny involving all but the royal bodyguard; but when Alexander dismissed his whole army and enrolled Persians instead, the opposition broke down. An emotional scene of reconciliation was followed by a vast banquet with 9,000 guests to celebrate the ending of the misunderstanding and the partnership in government of Macedonians and Persians—but not, as has been argued, the incorporation of all the subject peoples as partners in the commonwealth. Ten thousand veterans were now sent back to Macedonia with gifts, and the crisis was surmounted.\nIn summer 324 Alexander attempted to solve another problem, that of the wandering mercenaries, of whom there were thousands in Asia and Greece, many of them political exiles from their own cities. A decree brought by Nicanor to Europe and proclaimed at Olympia (September 324) required the Greek cities of the Greek League to receive back all exiles and their families (except the Thebans), a measure that implied some modification of the oligarchic regimes maintained in the Greek cities by Alexander’s governor Antipater . Alexander now planned to recall Antipater and supersede him by Craterus , but he was to die before this could be done.\nIn autumn 324 Hephaestion died in Ecbatana , and Alexander indulged in extravagant mourning for his closest friend; he was given a royal funeral in Babylon with a pyre costing 10,000 talents. His post of chiliarch (grand vizier) was left unfilled. It was probably in connection with a general order now sent out to the Greeks to honour Hephaestion as a hero that Alexander linked the demand that he himself should be accorded divine honours. For a long time his mind had dwelt on ideas of godhead. Greek thought drew no very decided line of demarcation between god and man, for legend offered more than one example of men who, by their achievements, acquired divine status. Alexander had on several occasions encouraged favourable comparison of his own accomplishments with those of Dionysus or Heracles . He now seems to have become convinced of the reality of his own divinity and to have required its acceptance by others. There is no reason to assume that his demand had any political background (divine status gave its possessor no particular rights in a Greek city); it was rather a symptom of growing megalomania and emotional instability. The cities perforce complied, but often ironically: the Spartan decree read, “Since Alexander wishes to be a god, let him be a god.”\nIn the winter of 324 Alexander carried out a savage punitive expedition against the Cossaeans in the hills of Luristan. The following spring at Babylon he received complimentary embassies from the Libyans and from the Bruttians, Etruscans , and Lucanians of Italy; but the story that embassies also came from more distant peoples, such as Carthaginians, Celts , Iberians , and even Romans, is a later invention. Representatives of the cities of Greece also came, garlanded as befitted Alexander’s divine status. Following up Nearchus’s voyage, he now founded an Alexandria at the mouth of the Tigris and made plans to develop sea communications with India, for which an expedition along the Arabian coast was to be a preliminary. He also dispatched Heracleides, an officer, to explore the Hyrcanian (i.e., Caspian ) Sea. Suddenly, in Babylon , while busy with plans to improve the irrigation of the Euphrates and to settle the coast of the Persian Gulf , Alexander was taken ill after a prolonged banquet and drinking bout; 10 days later, on June 13, 323, he died in his 33rd year; he had reigned for 12 years and eight months. His body, diverted to Egypt by Ptolemy , the later king, was eventually placed in a golden coffin in Alexandria . Both in Egypt and elsewhere in the Greek cities he received divine honours.\nNo heir had been appointed to the throne, and his generals adopted Philip II ’s half-witted illegitimate son, Philip Arrhidaeus , and Alexander’s posthumous son by Roxana, Alexander IV , as kings, sharing out the satrapies among themselves, after much bargaining. The empire could hardly survive Alexander’s death as a unit. Both kings were murdered, Arrhidaeus in 317 and Alexander in 310/309. The provinces became independent kingdoms, and the generals , following Antigonus ’s lead in 306, took the title of king.\nEvaluation\nOf Alexander’s plans little reliable information survives. The far-reaching schemes for the conquest of the western Mediterranean and the setting up of a universal monarchy, recorded by Diodorus Siculus , a 1st-century Greek historian, are probably based on a later forgery; if not, they were at once jettisoned by his successors and the army. Had he lived, he would no doubt have completed the conquest of Asia Minor, where Paphlagonia , Cappadocia , and Armenia still maintained an effective independence. But in his later years Alexander’s aims seem to have been directed toward exploration, in particular of Arabia and the Caspian .\nAlexander the Great, portrait head on a coin of Lysimachus (355–281 bce); in the British …\nCourtesy of the trustees of the British Museum; photograph, J.R. Freeman & Co. Ltd.\nIn the organization of his empire, Alexander had been content in many spheres to improvise and adapt what he found. His financial policy is an exception; though the details cannot be wholly recovered, it is clear that he set up a central organization with collectors perhaps independent of the local satraps. That this proved a failure was partly due to weaknesses in the character of Harpalus, his chief treasurer. But the establishment of a new coinage with a silver standard based on that of Athens in place of the old bimetallic system current both in Macedonia and in Persia helped trade everywhere and, combined with the release of vast amounts of bullion from the Persian treasuries, gave a much-needed fillip to the economy of the whole Mediterranean area.\nAlexander’s foundation of new cities — Plutarch speaks of over 70—initiated a new chapter in Greek expansion. No doubt many of the colonists, by no means volunteers, deserted these cities, and marriages with native women led to some dilution of Greek ways; but the Greek (rather than Macedonian) influence remained strong in most of them, and since the process was carried further by Alexander’s Seleucid successors, the spread of Hellenic thought and customs over much of Asia as far as Bactria and India was one of the more striking effects of Alexander’s conquests.\nHis plans for racial fusion, on the other hand, were a failure. The Iranian satraps were perhaps not efficient, for, out of 18, 10 were removed or executed—with what justice it is no longer possible to say. But, more important, the Macedonians, leaders and men alike, rejected the idea, and in the later Seleucid empire the Greek and Macedonian element was to be clearly dominant.\nHow far Alexander would have succeeded in the difficult task of coordinating his vast dominions, had he lived, is hard to determine. The only link between the many units that went to make up an empire more disparate than that of the Habsburgs , and far larger, was his own person; and his death came before he could tackle this problem.\nWhat had so far held it all together was his own dynamic personality. He combined an iron will and ability to drive himself and his men to the utmost with a supple and flexible mind; he knew when to draw back and change his policy, though he did this reluctantly. He was imaginative and not without romantic impulses; figures like Achilles , Heracles , and Dionysus were often in his mind, and the salutation at the oracle of Amon clearly influenced his thoughts and ambitions ever afterward. He was swift in anger, and under the strain of his long campaigns this side of his character grew more pronounced. Ruthless and self-willed, he had increasing recourse to terror, showing no hesitation in eliminating men whom he had ceased to trust, either with or without the pretense of a fair trial. Years after his death, Cassander , son of Antipater , a regent of the Macedonian empire under Alexander, could not pass his statue at Delphi without shuddering. Yet he maintained the loyalty of his men, who followed him to the Hyphasis without complaining and continued to believe in him throughout all hardships. Only when his whim would have taken them still farther into unknown India did he fail to get his way.\nAs a general Alexander is among the greatest the world has known. He showed unusual versatility both in the combination of different arms and in adapting his tactics to the challenge of enemies who commanded novel forms of warfare—the Shaka nomads, the Indian hill tribes, or Porus with his elephants. His strategy was skillful and imaginative, and he knew how to exploit the chances that arise in every battle and may be decisive for victory or defeat; he also drew the last advantage from victory by relentless pursuit. His use of cavalry was so effective that he rarely had to fall back upon his infantry to deliver the crushing blow.\nAlexander’s short reign marks a decisive moment in the history of Europe and Asia. His expedition and his own personal interest in scientific investigation brought many advances in the knowledge of geography and natural history . His career led to the moving of the great centres of civilization eastward and initiated the new age of the Greek territorial monarchies; it spread Hellenism in a vast colonizing wave throughout the Middle East and created, if not politically at least economically and culturally, a single world stretching from Gibraltar to the Punjab , open to trade and social intercourse and with a considerable overlay of common civilization and the Greek koinē as a lingua franca . It is not untrue to say that the Roman Empire , the spread of Christianity as a world religion, and the long centuries of Byzantium were all in some degree the fruits of Alexander’s achievement."

But exactly who, or what, do they represent? Found on Amorgos, the easternmost island in the Cyclades, this figurine may have been broken at the time of burial.\nNobody really knows what these [figurines] were used for. We frequently find them in cemeteries, which inherently suggests some sort of ritual connotation used in a funerary ceremony.\nBill Parkinson, Associate Curator, The Field Museum\nMore than 30 islands comprise the Cyclades, an archipelago located southeast of the Greek mainland in the Aegean Sea. Their name—from the Greek for circle or circular—refers to the chain of islands that encircle Delos, an island considered sacred by the ancient Greeks.\nGoddess or Priestess?\nAround 3200 BC, a remarkable culture emerged in the Cyclades, a circle of islands located at the heart of the Aegean Sea. This central location made it ideal for the exchange of goods and ideas; boats connected the Cyclades to Asia Minor (today’s Turkey), mainland Greece, and Crete.\nControl of these maritime trade routes, coupled with the quality of merchandise produced by local artisans, led to the rise of chiefs and a social hierarchy in the Cyclades. The female figurines excavated from wealthier burials represent high-status objects of this society. They were made of marble quarried from different islands in the Cyclades. Because the figurines share a number of features, there must have been cultural exchanges throughout the region.\nThe early Cycladic peoples did not use writing, so scholars look to the archaeological record for clues about this Bronze Age culture. (Early scripts appear in Crete and mainland Greece during later time periods.) The majority of figurines found in Cycladic graves are female and nude, strongly suggesting associations with fertility. But scholars disagree on exactly what the sculptures represent: mother-goddesses? priestesses or worshippers? Their exact function and meaning remain a mystery.\nA few facts\nμάρμαρος (marmaros)\nwhite shining stone\nLimestone that’s been transformed by heat and pressure within the earth into the rock used in monuments, Greek statues, and the facade of your favorite natural history museum.\nit's made of…\nmarble\nCycladic marble is very, very difficult to work. [The figurines] were etched, probably with bronze tools or stone tools, and then ground with sand to give them their fine texture. A lot of labor went into making these things.\nBill Parkinson\n“Mask of Agamemnon”\nModern replica of original death mask\nThis face is one of the most celebrated images of Greek archaeology. German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann ultimately attributed it to Agamemnon, the legendary king of Homer’s Iliad. This one-of-a-kind replica—on exhibit in The Greeks—was produced by artist Emile Gillieron in consultation with Schliemann using ancient techniques.\nThe irony is that [Schliemann] finds this gold mask and he says, ‘I've gazed upon the eyes of Agamemnon.’ Well, the Agamemnon that Homer's writing about wouldn't have been this guy because the burial dates to the 16th century BC. If Agamemnon ever existed, he would have lived several hundred years later when the site of Mycenae became the capital of this big complicated Mycenaean state.\nBill Parkinson, Associate Curator, The Field Museum\nMycenaean Greece—named for Mycenae, its largest citadel—was divided into local kingdoms based on a hierarchical system led by a king and staffed by a series of bureaucrats. Scribes recorded transactions on clay tablets in Linear B script. With its decipherment and attribution as an early form of the ancient Greek language, Mycenae can be considered the first-known “Greek” culture or civilization.\nSearching for Mythic Warriors\nLegend says that Agamemnon was the first to unite the Greeks in a common cause: avenging the honor of his brother Menelaus, whose wife—the beautiful Helen—had been abducted by a Trojan prince. It is easy to imagine Agamemnon marching his troops through the Lion Gate of Mycenae and off into battle.\nDid he really exist? No one knows for sure. The Greek poet Homer imagined Agamemnon as the lord of Mycenae, long after the citadel itself had fallen to ruin. Heinrich Schliemann, the 19th-century German archaeologist, began excavating at Mycenae in 1875, convinced that the ruins were those of the city ruled by Agamemnon.\nAfter uncovering a gold funerary mask, Schliemann is believed to have telegrammed the famous words, “I have gazed upon the eyes of Agamemnon.” But a short time later, Schliemann unearthed a second gold mask. Struck by its noble features, he decided he’d been wrong, and that this was the actual mask worn by the Greek hero and conqueror of Troy.\nHowever, neither of these gold masks could have belonged to Agamemnon. The royal graves existed at least three centuries before the supposed time of the Trojan War. Despite that, Schliemann remains famous for discovering the site of the most powerful—and legendary—city in Bronze Age Greece.\nA few facts\nMycenae, 16th century BC (reproduction)\nEtymology\nἀρχαῖοςλόγος (archaioslogos)\nancientto study\nWe got our word for the study of the remains of ancient cultures from… an ancient culture.\nit's made of…\nGold\nIn the Aegean, gold was rare. It's astonishing that we ever find gold in the ground because it's so easy to rework it, to melt it and reuse it. But clearly, in these graves at Mycenae, you can tell that gold was a very valuable raw material—when they buried someone with a ton of gold and a gold mask, they demonstrated that person’s wealth, power, and privilege.\nBill Parkinson\nAchilles Avenging Patroclos\noil jar\nThe painting on this oil jar (or lekythos) depicts a scene from Homer's epic poem the Iliad. Here, the Greek hero, Achilles, avenges the death of his friend Patroclos by killing the Trojan leader, Hector.\n[Epic poems] record stories that are a blending of some things that are clearly historical and that have been passed down for… hundreds of years. But they also border on mythology. So it's very difficult in these stories to tell what is history and what is myth. But what we see is, that when they're written down, they continue to have a very big impact on Greek society.\nBill Parkinson, Associate Curator, The Field Museum\nAlthough we have no accurate images of Homer from his lifetime, many were created from the fifth through the second centuries BC. This head, depicting the poet in old age, is a Roman copy of a Greek original.\nPortrait of Homer, about 150 AD. © National Archaeological Museum, Athens\nHomer and Heroes\nWe know very little about the life of Homer, the greatest epic poet of ancient Greece. Was he poor and blind as legend has suggested? Scholars debate if he was an itinerant minstrel or associated with a powerful court. One thing is certain: his major works, the Iliad and the Odyssey, inspired and influenced generations of storytellers and writers who lived after him.\nBoth of these epic poems probably began as oral traditions, which were later written down and attributed to Homer, who lived during the eighth century BC. The Iliad tells the story of the Trojan War, traditionally dated to the 12th century BC—some 400 years before Homer.\nHomer’s other major work, the Odyssey, is the sequel to the Iliad. It describes the adventures of the Greek hero, Odysseus, who overcame a number of challenges before returning home to the island of Ithaca after the Trojan War. His example of courage and determination continues to inspire us.\nHomer’s epic poems—filled with tales of bravery, love, jealousy, and betrayal—are considered the earliest works of Western literature. They greatly influenced later writers, including Virgil and Dante, who continued the tradition of epic poetry. But Homer’s works also inspired countless novelists and playwrights, where the “hero’s journey” remains central to the narrative plot.\nA few facts\nἔπος (epos)\nword or song\nOnce a word for stories, songs, and poems—such as the Iliad and the Odyssey—now used to describe things so awesome they deserve to have their praises sung.\nit's made of…\nCeramic\nGreek artisans painted vessels with a material that turned black during firing, leaving the background the red color of the clay. This “black-figure” technique was used to decorate fine pottery, often with scenes from Greek mythology. Vases were often made in specific shapes for specific uses. The shape of this vessel indicates it was likely made for storing oil used during funeral rites.\n© National Archaeological Museum, Athens\nSelf-Crowning Athlete\nVotive Relief\nThis sculpture may have been offered in gratitude by an athlete following a victory. It shows a young man placing an olive wreath on his head, a symbol of victory. The “self-crowning athlete” came to represent democracy in ancient Athens where the right to self-governance could be earned through citizenship.\nThe Agora was the center of public life in Athens. The name means “gathering place” or “assembly,” and it basically functioned as the city’s town square. It was here that citizens of Athens voted for leaders, participated in athletic contests, and worshipped at important altars and temples.\nOlympians and “Rule by the People”\nBeginning in 776 BC, athletes converged every four years in the Greek city of Olympia to take part in the Olympic Games. At their heart, the games were a religious celebration. The athletes competed to honor Zeus, and a large temple was built for him at Olympia. The games were considered so sacred that violence between Greece’s often-feuding city-states was banned during the competition.\nAlthough the events changed over time, the most common included running, wrestling, boxing, pankration (mixed martial arts), horse and chariot racing, and the pentathlon (five separate competitions over the course of a single day).\nThe winning athlete was crowned champion with a wreath. His exploits might be recounted in poems. His likeness could be carved in stone to memorialize his victories, then dedicated to Zeus at the temple.\nThis fragmentary sculpture of the “self-crowning athlete” might actually depict an athlete taking off his wreath and preparing to dedicate it to a god or goddess. But the carving has also been interpreted as a metaphor of the Athenian people who chose to govern themselves through an early system of democracy—in essence, to crown themselves as their own leaders and determine their own destinies. It is an ideal that lives on today in our own system of government and rule by the people.\nA few facts\nδῆμοςκράτος (demoskratos)\nthe peoplepower or rule\nPower to the people—the Greeks did it first (or at least, they put a name on it).\nAthenian Democracy\nAncient Athens is considered the birthplace of Western democracy. For the first time, citizens were able to express themselves, debate issues, and vote, as long as they met the criteria for citizenship. Citizens had to be free men—which excluded women and slaves—had to be born of Athenian parents, and had to be at least 18 years of age.\n© National Archaeological Museum, Athens\nOffering to Asklepios\nVotive Relief\nAsklepios, god of medicine, leans on his staff, around which a snake is coiled. Accompanied by his children, he receives the tributes of mortals (smaller in size) whom he has cured. This type of object was placed in sanctuaries dedicated to the god.\nThe snake-entwined staff carried by Askelpios is a symbol of medicine. Its exact meaning and symbolism is debated, but one interpretation is that the snake represents renewal and rejuvenation, a kind of “sloughing off sickness” as a snake sheds its skin. The Rod of Asklepios is often confused with the caduceus—two snakes wrapped around a winged staff—a symbol of commerce carried by the Greek god Hermes.\nPhilosopher Physicians\nDuring Greece’s Classical period, the citizens of Athens challenged conventional wisdom and presented the Western world with philosophy, theater, art, science—and medicine.\nTo care for people suffering from illnesses, the Athenians built an asklepeion, or healing temple, dedicated to the Greek god of medicine, Asklepios. Here, patients spent the night in a dormitory—a precedent of today’s hospitals—and were treated for a variety of illnesses.\nPhysicians practiced under guidelines established by Hippocrates, often called “the father of Western medicine.” Hippocrates separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the gods, but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits.\nHippocrates also established ethical and professional guidelines for physicians, including the hippocratic oath, a version of which modern-day doctors still follow. The original oath began with this pledge:\nI swear by Apollo the physician, and Asklepios the surgeon, likewise Hygeia and Panacea, and call all the gods and goddesses to witness, that I will observe and keep this underwritten oath, to the utmost of my power and judgment.\nThe legacy of ancient Greek medicine continues today with medical terms derived from the Greek language: hygienic, epidemic, and chronic to name just a few.\nA few facts\nβίοςλόγος (bioslogos)\nlifeto study\nAspiring doctors taking biology classes are studying life itself. Kind of puts all other fields of study into perspective, doesn't it?\nOfferings to the Gods\nThe ancient Greeks gave votive offerings at temples and sacred sites to thank the gods for granting them a wish. The type, material, and size of the dedications reflected the social status of the devotee. This finely worked and expertly carved relief sculpture dedicated to the god Asklepios was probably commissioned by a wealthy family in gratitude for a loved one cured of an illness.\n© Archaeological Museum of Pella\nAlexander as the God Pan\nSculpture\nThis small masterpiece is probably inspired by the early statues of Alexander by Lysippus, the famous Greek sculptor. Here the king is portrayed as an idealized model of male beauty, but also as a deity. The small horns on either side of his forehead suggest that he represents Pan, god of wildlife.\nThis is a representation of Alexander as Pan. Even though it's smaller than you’d think, it's actually really cool. It's clearly a depiction of Alexander based on the face and the pose. And it’s got horns, which indicates that this is yet another depiction of Alexander as a god, in this case, Pan, the goat-like god of wildlife.\nBill Parkinson, Associate Curator, The Field Museum\nThis youthful portrait of Alexander incorporated both realistic and idealized features. A number of details, supported by rare physical descriptions of Alexander from ancient writings, make it possible to recognize him:\nthe slight tilt of his head,\nthe arrangement of his hair,\nhis lack of beard which differentiated him from other rulers of the time,\nand his upward glance.\nPortrait of Alexander, Pella, fourth century BC. © Archaeological Museum of Pella\nConquerors, Rulers, and Gods\nIt was a major turning point in history. Philip II of Macedon unified Greece through a series of military victories, diplomatic alliances, and seven marriages. Philip’s son, Alexander the Great, would go even further. Conquering a large portion of the ancient world, he was seen as a god, and would be immortalized for all time.\nAlexander was only 20 when his father was assassinated. Thanks, however, to his education under the Greek philosopher Aristotle and his training in the formidable Macedonian army, he was ready to lead. Within a single generation the ancient world was transformed as Alexander the Great conquered nations to create a vast, multi-ethnic empire.\nDuring the course of his conquests, Alexander founded many cities—one of the most famous being Alexandria, Egypt—as bases of military control, but also as centers of Greek language, learning, and culture. It was through these cities that Greek civilization was disseminated through much of the known world.\nAlexander called himself a son of Zeus, and many of his portraits depict him as a demi-god. Several portraits were produced by important painters and sculptors during Alexander’s lifetime and even after his death. Alexander’s political successors used copies of his image to associate themselves with the conqueror’s legend, power, and supposed divinity.\nA few facts\nκόσμοςπολίτης (kosmospolites)\nworldcitizen\nWhen you lived in the largest ancient empire, it wasn’t hard to think of yourself as a classy, sophisticated “citizen of the world.” (No word on whether the Greeks also cornered the market on women’s magazines with questionable dating tips.)\nAlexander’s Empire\nAlexander’s empire stretched some 4000 miles from the Adriatic Sea in the west to the Indus River in the east.

    "content": "HISTORY OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT\nList of subjects  |  Sources  |  Feedback   HISTORY OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT    \nHISTORY OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT\nEnjoy the Famous Daily\nAn inspiring inheritance:  356 BC\nAlexander is born in Pella, the Macedonian capital, at about the time his father becomes king of Macedonia. Philip II 's expansion of the kingdom, an unfolding saga of glory and excitement, is Alexander's boyhood.\nAt an early age he proves himself well equipped to share in these military adventures. He is only sixteen when he is left in charge of Macedonia, while his father campaigns in the east against Byzantium. During his father's absence he crushes a rebellious tribe, the Thracians. As a reward he is allowed to found a new town in their territory - Alexandropolis, the first of many to be named after him.\n \nMacedonia is considered by other Greek states to be a backward place, but the education of the prince is the best that Greece can provide. In 343, when Alexander is thirteen, Philip invites Aristotle to become the royal tutor.\nFor three years the philosopher teaches the prince. No doubt they study Homer together. The Iliad becomes a profound source of inspiration to Alexander. Scrolls of the text will later be kept beside him in his tent while he achieves military feats to put the Homeric heroes to shame. Alexander and his most intimate friend from childhood days, Hephaestion, are compared by their contemporaries to the Homeric hero Achilles and his lover Patroclus.\n \nPhilip's campaign in 340 against Byzantium provokes Athens and Thebes into taking the field against the Macedonians. The two sides meet in 338 at Chaeronaea. Later tradition credits the 18-year-old Alexander with leading a cavalry charge which decides the outcome of the battle. There is no historical evidence for this. But the prince certainly fights at Chaeronaea, and the day ends with a conclusive win for the Macedonians.\nThis victory enables Philip to present himself as the leader of all the Greek states. His position is formally acknowledged at a congress in Corinth, in 337.\n \nThe campaign against Persia:  from 336 BC\nOne of the resolutions of the League of Corinth is to launch a war against Persia, with Philip as commander of the confederate forces. In the following spring (336) an advance guard of 10,000 troops sets off eastwards. But that same summer, at a feast to celebrate the wedding of his daughter, Philip is murdered by one of his courtiers.\nThe League immediately elects his son, Alexander, in his place as commander. But this degree of unity is short-lived. The Thebans rebel against the League.  Alexander storms Thebes in 335 BC, killing 6000. He then puts into effect a stern judgement by the council of the League. Theban territory is divided between its neighbours. The surviving Thebans are enslaved.\n \nThis display of ruthless authority enables Alexander to leave Macedonia under the control of a regent, with reasonable confidence that Greece will remain calm during what may prove to be a prolonged absence.\nIn the spring of 334, still at the age of only twenty-two, Alexander marches east with some 5000 cavalry and 30,000 footsoldiers. There are ancient scores to be settled between Greece and Persia . And they will be settled fast. But first he engages in some romantic tourism, making a pilgrimage to the site of Troy . In a classic Greek ceremony he runs naked to the supposed tomb of Achilles, to place a garland. He is presented with a shield, said to have been dedicated by the Trojans to Athena.\n \nFrom now on this sacred shield invariably accompanies Alexander into battle. It soon sees action. A short distance to the east of Troy a Persian army awaits the Macedonians. The battle is fought at the river Granicus, with Alexander leading a cavalry charge through the water. The Persians are routed. Many of their troops are Greek mercenaries, of whom thousands are captured. Most of them are killed, but 2000 are sent back to Macedonia in chains to provide slave labour in the mines.\nA year later, at Issus, Alexander defeats an army led by the Persian emperor, Darius III. He captures the emperor's mother, wife and children and treats them with every courtesy - a detail which does much for his reputation.\n \nThe destruction of the Persian empire:  333 - 330 BC\nWithin a mere eighteen months Alexander has cleared the Persians out of Anatolia , which they have held for two centuries. The conqueror now moves south along the coast through present-day Syria, Lebanon and Israel. The ports here are the home bases of the Persian fleet in the Mediterranean. By occupying them he intends to cripple the fleet and deprive it of contact with the cities of the empire, including Persepolis . Most of the Phoenician towns open their gates to him. The exception is the greatest of them all, Tyre, which he besieges for seven months (see the Siege of Tyre ).\nBy the autumn of 332 Alexander is in Egypt. The Persian governor rapidly surrenders.\n \nAlexander spends the winter in Egypt. His actions there are the first indication of how he will set about keeping control of distant conquests, places with their own cultural traditions. One method is to establish outposts of Greek culture. In Egypt he founds the greatest of the cities known by his name - Alexandria .\nAnother method, equally important, is to present himself in the guise of a local ruler. To this end he carries out a sacrifice to Apis, a sacred bull at Memphis , where the priests crown him pharaoh. And he makes a long pilgrimage to a famous oracle of the sun god Amon, or Amen-Re , at Siwa. The priest duly recognizes Alexander as the son of the god.\n \nIn the spring of 331 Alexander is ready to move northeast into Mesopotamia, where he meets and defeats the Persian emperor Darius in the decisive battle of Gaugamela. His way is now open to the great Persian capital city of Persepolis .\nIn a symbolic gesture, ending conclusively the long wars between Greeks and Persians, he burns the palace of Xerxes in 330 (legend maintains that he is prompted to this act of vandalism by his Athenian mistress, Thaïs, after a drunken party). To make plain who now rules the Persian empire, Alexander adopts the ceremonial dress and court rituals of the emperor.\n \nAlexander in the east:  330 - 323 BC\nFor  two years Alexander moves through his newly acquired empire (which stretches north beyond Samarkand and eastwards through modern Afghanistan) subduing any pockets of opposition and establishing Greek settlements. Then he goes further, in 327, through the mountain passes into India .\nOne of the towns founded by Alexander in India is called Bucephala. It is named to commemorate his famous horse, Bucephalus, which dies here at what turns out to be the furthest point of this astonishing expedition. Alexander's troops threaten to mutiny in the Indian monsoon. At last, in 325, he turns for home.\n \nWith his army reinforced by some Indian elephants, Alexander is back in Persia. In 324 he holds a great feast at Susa to celebrate the capture of the Persian empire. During the festivities, to emphasize that Greece and Persia are now one, he and eighty of his officers marry Persian wives. His own bride on this occasion is one of the daughters of Darius. Another daughter is married to Hephaestion\nLater that year Hephaestion dies of a fever at Ecbatana. Alexander mourns extravagantly for his most intimate friend, ordering great shrines to be built in Hephaestion's honour. But in the following year, 323, after a banquet at Babylon, he himself is suddenly taken ill and dies. The greatest conqueror in history, he is still only thirty-two.\n \nThe legacy of conquest:  from 323 BC\nAlexander has no heir (though the posthumous son of one of his wives is formally referred to as the king, until murdered in his early teens in 309). So Alexander's generals set about carving up the new empire.\nAfter prolonged warfare two of them emerge with sizable portions. Ptolemy establishes himself in Egypt. And Seleucus wins control of a vast area - Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Persia and the eastern part of the empire, including at first even the territories in India.\n \nPtolemy adds legitimacy to his rule in Egypt by acquiring Alexander's body. He intercepts the embalmed corpse on its way to burial, brings it to Egypt and places it in a golden coffin in Alexandria.\nIt will remain one of the famous sights of the town for many years, until probably destroyed in riots in the 3rd century AD.\n \nThe companions of Alexander the Great are Greek in origin, as Macedonians, and their descendants continue to see themselves as Greeks. A veneer of Greek culture is the lasting result of Alexander's conquests. It is spread thinly from Egypt to Persia and even beyond the Khyber Pass, in addition to the many Mediterranean regions lying closer to Greece.\nThese places do not become Greek, but they acquire a Greek tinge - for which the 19th century coins a name, Hellenistic. Alexander's victories launch the Hellenistic ('Greek-ish') Age, which will last until the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC.\n \nMacedonia itself, Alexander's homeland, is subject to a succession of violent upheavals. In one of them his mother, Olympias, arrives with an army in 317 BC and kills his half-witted half-brother, Philip III, together with Philip's wife and 100 of his supporters. She loses her own life in the next coup, in the following year.\nIn 276 a stable dynasty is at last established by descendants of Antigonus, another of Alexander's generals. But its future is relatively short. As the most westerly part of Alexander's empire, Macedonia is the first region to be devoured by its imperial successor. Rome first invades Macedonia in 197 BC. From 148 Macedonia is reduced to the status of a Roman province. Not until the 19th century does it feature prominently again in history.\n \nBut nothing can dim the memory of Alexander the Great.\nThe regimental song of the British Grenadiers, seeking to list heroes in the Grenadier class, begins with the line: 'Some talk of Alexander, and some of Hercules'. The tourist to Troy, in 333 BC, would be pleased with the choice of his companion for the opening line - and pleased too with the order of listing, even if it is imposed by considerations of rhythm and rhyme."

The grocery chain has become known for its high-priced food and says its new chain will offer \"value prices.\"\nTony Dejak/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nUpscale grocery store chain Whole Foods (often referred to as \"Whole Paycheck\" because of its high prices) announced this week that it's launching a new offshoot brand — with lower prices — to appeal to younger, millennial shoppers.\nWalter Robb, co-CEO of Whole Foods, says it will be a \"uniquely branded store concept unlike anything that currently exists in the marketplace\" with \"value prices ... a modern, streamlined design, innovative technology and a curated selection.\"\nThe news comes just as the company touted a 10 percent sales increase to $3.6 billion, and an earnings per share increase of 14 percent over the prior year. At the same time, Whole Foods disappointed investors by missing its profit estimates for the second quarter and by reporting lower than expected same-store sales, as NPR's Brian Naylor reported .\nBut Anthony Dukes , a marketing professor at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, says the announcement may have more to do with combating stigma than with any current revenue figures.\n\"Whole Foods has come under criticism for having high prices, the famous 'Whole Paycheck' idea of Whole Foods — charging prices that a lot of people can't afford,\" says Dukes. \"And that's not been particularly good for Whole Foods' image. That price issue has been a thorn in their side. And if that's keeping some people away, because they feel it's too expensive, that new format addresses that issue.\"\nArticle continues after sponsorship\nDukes also says Whole Foods' move is in line with recent trends in the grocery industry. \"Grocery has done a really good thing in the past decade or so in regard to understanding this notion of curation, and segmenting, and fine-tuning their assortment to what customers like,\" says Dukes. \"It used to be that grocery stores would survive and compete based on location — just have everything anybody in your location might want.\"\nNow, he says, grocery stores are realizing they can offer different experiences for different customers: those who want an upscale setting and high prices, and others who prefer lower prices.\nDukes says doing that well, though, takes effort, and the challenge will be doing it in a way that doesn't make current Whole Foods shoppers jump ship for its cheaper offshoot. He points to automaker Toyota, which launched its Scion car line to shake its baby boomer image and appeal to younger consumers with less money to spend.\nScion works, says Dukes, because it successfully differentiated from Toyota. \"It's [Scion's] actually ugly to the people who buy a conventional Toyota,\" says Dukes. \"And that was the way that they could reach this new market without cannibalizing their existing one, because people who bought a Toyota wouldn't be caught dead driving a Scion.\"\nCollege student Skylar Bowman, 22, is outside of a Whole Foods in West Los Angeles. Stepping into her Mini Cooper and holding a kale, flax seed, almond milk, spinach and honey smoothie, Bowman says she'd give the new chain a shot. But, she says she wants the stores to keep the Whole Foods \"vibe.\"\n\"I love the community, I love the energy, the people who work at Whole Foods, so I hope that transitions,\" she said.\nBut Bowman, who's paying her way through college, admits that she buys staples at other grocery stores, like Trader Joe's, and only comes to Whole Foods for special smoothies, and other items she can't get anywhere else.\nAnother Los Angeles Whole Foods customer, 32-year-old Elise Roberts, says she actually hopes the new store changes one Whole Foods characteristic significantly: \"The snotty attitude of the other customers.\" She wasn't alone.\nJust down the road at competitor Trader Joe's, 27-year-old shopper Bridgette Williams says, \"When I think Whole Foods, I think I'm going spend a lot of money, so I don't go there.\"\nWhole Foods has yet to announce a name for the spinoff. Our unofficial poll in several grocery store parking lots gave us two good options: Wholer Foods and Half Foods. Of course, the company could just riff off its ongoing joke, and call the new chain \"Half Paycheck.\"\nThe company says it's currently negotiating leases and building a team for the new chain. And it plans to open stores next year."

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\n×\nWhole Foods, sometimes referred to as “Whole Paycheck” to open new, lower-cost chain\nHONG KONG (CNNMoney) — Whole Foods is gearing up to open a new, lower-cost chain of stores next year aimed at younger shoppers.\nThe new chain will cost less to operate, but be “hip, cool, and technology-oriented,” CEO John Mackey said on a conference call. The idea is to stock cheaper goods that will attract cost-conscious buyers, while maintaining the company’s quality standards.\nWhole Foods, a pioneer in high-end groceries, continues to open new stores every year. But the company — which some refer to as “Whole Paycheck” — has sought to diversify as more competitors pile into the market.\n“We’ve been so successful that we’ve actually bred a lot more competition and everyone is jumping on the natural and organic food bandwagon, and that’s really, frankly, due to our success,” Mackey said. “You have to be willing to evolve with the marketplace … to serve your customers.”\nWhole Foods is currently negotiating leases for the new stores, but Mackey declined to give the name and number of stores planned. He said the company would announce more details by early September.\nThe company announced quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Same-store sales grew by 3.6%, and overall sales jumped 10% to a record $3.6 billion. But investors were expecting better figures, sending the stock down by more than 11% in New York after-hours trading.\nWhole Foods currently operates 417 stores and plans to open 23 new ones this year. The company said it expects sales growth this year of more than 9%, and same-store sales growth in the low to mid-single digits."

It appears — hold on to your organic heirloom tomatoes — that may be the case.\nAs shared by Yahoo Finance , a recent analysis conducted by Deutsche Bank, in which the prices of 77 items were compared between the two stores, found that Trader Joe’s had widened the gap to 26 percent between its and Whole Foods’ prices. This cost savings has increased from a previous 2013 analysis conducted by the firm. Trader Joe’s prices were 30 percent cheaper than Whole Foods on perishable goods and 24 percent cheaper for nonperishable goods, while Trader Joe’s private-label items came in only 15 percent cheaper than Whole Foods’ 365 private label.\nThe price reduction seems to have forced Whole Foods to follow suit with its own price cuts on similar items, according to Deutsche Bank Analyst Karen Short. In a research note, Short stated: “[Trader Joe’s] might be once again catching [Whole Foods] off guard because prior checks have not shown such disparity.”\nWith 500 stores in the U.S., Trader Joe’s has increased its retail footprint significantly in the past few years, while Whole Foods has expanded more slowly. According to the story by Yahoo Finance, the latter chain plans to open three more of its new 365 concept stores in 2016 and 10 more in 2017.\nThe company says that it has been cutting prices across the board, as well as highlighting more limited-time discounts. Whole Foods will also be introducing a range of lower-priced products at its new chain of 365 by Whole Foods Market stores. Short notes, “The wide price delta between TJ’s private-label products and [Whole Foods’] ‘365’ private brand … was a surprise to us given that the ‘365’ brand strategy has generally been to match TJ’s on price in private label.” She goes on to point out, “[Whole Foods’] private label is meaningfully higher in quality and, therefore, justifies a premium.”"

But those high prices might be seen now as theft and part of a deceptive trade practice, as New York City’s Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) Commissioner examines whether or not Whole Foods has been purposely overcharging its patrons for pre-packaged food.\nThe DCA claims that it investigated “80 different kinds of pre-packaged products at New York Whole Foods outlets and found all had mislabeled weights.”  The DCA also provided several other examples of packaged food overcharging, often based on weight:\nEight packages of vegetable platters priced at $20/package. Consumers who purchased these packages would have been, on average, overcharged by $2.50—a profit of $20 for the eight packages. One package was overpriced by $6.15.\nEight packages of chicken tenders priced at $9.99/pound. Consumers who purchased these packages would have been, on average, overcharged by $4.13—a profit of $33.04 for the eight packages. One package was overpriced by $4.85.\nFour packages of berries priced at $8.58/package. Consumers who purchased these packages would have been, on average, overcharged by $1.15—a profit of $4.60 for the four packages. One package was overpriced by $1.84.\nThis is not the first time Whole Foods has faced accusations of overcharging. As reported by WTOP , “last year, Whole Foods agreed to pay $800,000 in penalties — and improve pricing accuracy — after an investigation into alleged pricing irregularities in California.” The current investigation looked into 8 stores around the city, though a 9th store opened after the investigation ended.\nWhat Whole Foods is saying\nThe grocery chain is, of course, denying any wrongdoing. According to NBC News , Whole Foods “disagrees with the DCA’s overreaching allegations…. Despite our requests to the DCA, they have not provided evidence to back up their demands nor have they requested any additional information from us, but instead have taken this to the media to coerce us.” It might be easier to “sympathize” with the chain if they had not paid close to a million dollars for this same exact problem in a different state; now, it simply looks like they are attempting to pull one over on their customers again.\nWhat happens next?\nIf Whole Foods purposely mislabeled the prices on their pre-packaged foods and overcharged customers for those foods, then they have committed an act of consumer fraud. People who were misled into overpaying will have options available to them. They can sue Whole Foods for deceptive trade practices , like the Florida-based Southeast Consumer Alliance Inc. did in 2011. Consumers could also choose to band together and start a class-action lawsuit to recoup any potential losses they may have suffered over the last 5 years .\nEither way, CEO John Mackey may be in hot water soon for deceiving the customers he claims to care about so much. Acts like these violate the law and hurt consumers. Perhaps it is time for us all to say “no more” to Whole Foods’ deceptive practices one and for all.\nLeave A Comment"

    "content": "Turnaround at Whole Foods: Good sign for whole economy? - Aug. 5, 2009\nor View results\nShares of the organic grocery store chain have rebounded sharply this year, but the stock is still well-below the levels it traded at before the recession.\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Looking for more evidence that maybe, just maybe, those green shoots aren't really just sprouts of crabgrass? Look no further than the comeback of Whole Foods Market.\nThe organic food retailer -- jokingly referred to by many as \"Whole Paycheck\" because prices are so high compared to other supermarkets --actually reported a slight increase in its fiscal-third quarter profits Tuesday. Analysts were expecting a 13% decline in earnings.\nFor Whole Foods ( WFMI , Fortune 500 ), which had been struggling well before the recession hit, this was the first time that earnings rose on a year-over-year basis since the third quarter of 2006.\nSure, like many other companies, Whole Foods benefited from cost cutting. But sales did rise 2%, so growth was not just a function of firing people and reducing corporate expenses.\nWall Street ate up the news. The stock soared more than 15% Wednesday, continuing a surge that began earlier this year on economic recovery hopes.\nBut does the fact that consumers are once again embracing Whole Paycheck really a sign that the economy is getting back on track?\nIt's tough to say. Consumer spending did decline in the second quarter as many hunkered down and added to their savings. That trend is likely to continue.\nWith that in mind, it was interesting to note that Whole Foods executives went out of their way to stress during the company's conference call Wednesday that they are not trying to position Whole Foods as a grocery store only for the affluent.\n\"We do not believe we are marketing to an upper-income customer. We have never believed that. We are primarily marketing to a well-educated customer, a customer who has made a lifestyle change and that tends to correlate in terms of healthy eating with being a better informed customer, better educated,\" said chief executive officer John Mackey.\nTalkback: Do you shop at Whole Foods or do you think their prices are still too high? Leave your comments at the bottom of this story.\nCo-chief operating officer Walter Robb added that the company has been focusing on keeping prices lower in the past year in order to slow the loss of customers. Robb said that these efforts were a key factor in the company's recent success.\n\"People are giving us increasing credit for being competitive, and also they're seeing the visibility of the value in the stores,\" he said.\nAnd it does seem that consumers, while remaining thrifty, are willing to shell out on the finer things in life, whether it's an organic free-range chicken or a new car , if the prices seem reasonable.\n\"It is possible that with a better value image, WFMI is benefiting from more confident consumers spending their marginal disposable income on modest luxuries, like lunch at Whole Foods,\" wrote Jefferies & Co. analyst Scott Mushkin in a report Wednesday.\n0:00 /2:34 Profiting from green eats\nBut make no mistake. Whole Foods hasn't suddenly transformed into Wal-Mart, or for that matter, Kroger.\nAnd even though total revenue was up, sales at stores open at least a year, a key figure in retailing known as same-store or comparable sales, fell 3.8% from a year ago. So the total sales growth was due more to an increase in the number of stores.\nAs such, Simeon Gutman, an analyst with Canaccord Adams, said that the company still needs to show that demand is really improving.\n\"They're getting a little bit of foot traffic back. There's not this same feeling of devastation that we had six months ago,\" he said. \"But going forward, sales are going to have to be more responsible for earnings growth. That's a more challenging proposition.\"\nCEO Mackey conceded that Whole Foods is kind of like the proverbial canary in the coal mine for consumer sentiment. It seems safe to suggest that if more people are willing to spend $4.79 for a box of six Kashi TLC granola bars (that was the regular price listed for Whole Foods stores in Manhattan), they must be more confident.\n\"It could be the economy is firming up and people are feeling like we're going to avoid a depression,\" Mackey said. \"You could take this as an early indicator that maybe the economy is getting better if Whole Foods has firmed up some. But we don't really know.\"\nAnd that's the scary thing. Nobody really knows. So far, Whole Foods appears to be the only high-end (sorry, Mr. Mackey, but perception is reality) retailer to be making a comeback.\nStill tough times for retail\nHandbag maker Coach ( COH ) reported last week that its fiscal fourth-quarter sales were down slightly and that profits plunged 32% from a year ago.\nJeweler Tiffany & Co. ( TIF ) and apparel retailer Nordstrom ( JWN , Fortune 500 ) will report their second-quarter results later this month. Analysts are expecting sizeable drops in sales and earnings for both companies.\nAnd even if you agree with the notion that Whole Foods is just a grocery store chain, results from other supermarkets aren't looking too promising.\nSupervalu ( SVU , Fortune 500 ) reported a 30% decline in first-quarter earnings last week while Safeway ( SWY , Fortune 500 ) recently lowered its full-year profit and same-store sales targets for the second time this year.\nAs a result, Bob Summers, an analyst with Pali Capital, suggests that the turnaround at Whole Foods is simply a refection that the company's efforts to get back on track after years of poor performance. So it's just good news for Whole Foods, not the broader economy.\n\"It would be categorically inappropriate to extrapolate Whole Foods' results as a sign that the consumer is recovering,\" said Summers. \"If you look at what retail sales are, they are still pretty horrific.\"\nTalkback : Do you shop at Whole Foods or do you think their prices are still too high? \nFirst Published: August 5, 2009: 1:04 PM ET"

A new store model, named 365 by Whole Foods Market, is the organic grocer’s latest attempt to reach a younger, more budget-conscious consumer.\nNow outnumbering Baby Boomers, the millennial generation has become the largest age group and Whole Foods has had problems in the past attracting this crowd. The organic grocery giant has been tinkering with different out-of-the-box ideas for the past year to widen its appeal beyond groceries.\nTo attract a younger generation, Whole Foods may consider adding a tattoo parlor to some stores. [Photo by Oli Scarff/Getty Images]\nAs reported by CBS News, the latest strategy by the organic foods juggernaut is the opening of the new 365 stores in hopes of appealing specifically to millennials looking for a more convenient, budget-friendly option. According to the company, the store locations will be smaller than typical Whole Foods locations and only offer a carefully chosen assortment of goods.\nWalter Robb, co-chief executive officer for Whole Foods says the company has a unique plan to entice younger shoppers. Part of that plan is to provide outside services and products inside the 365 stores tailored to meet millennial interests.\nEach store will have a mix of outside vendors offering a range of products and services from food and drink to fashion and body care products. Some of these outside merchants may even include a record shop or tattoo parlor.\n— Stewart Samuel (@Stewart_IGD) October 26, 2015\nKnown as “Friends of 365,” Whole Foods is actively recruiting new partners in several categories to give customers a unique shopping experience. Whole Foods is asking potential vendors to send them an email if they want to be considered.\nOne possible outside partner could be Mendocino Farms. Partially owned by Whole Foods, the restaurant chain may have the opportunity to open up new locations right inside the 365 stores. Having a restaurant that offers freshly prepared meals, like sandwiches and “not so fried” chicken, would be a natural fit for the new concept.\nThe company has not revealed if any new vendors have been officially picked.\nOften referred to as “whole paycheck,” Whole Foods has struggled to compete against lower-priced rivals like Trader Joe’s. In November, the company introduced a plan to change their reputation by increasing discounts.\n“There’s a number of smaller-store competitors out there that are doing a nice job,” Robb said. “We don’t see any reason why we can’t go participate in that part of the market.”\nWhole Foods is opening new stores designed to attract more budget-conscious consumers. [Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]\nOver the past few years, Whole Foods has lost considerable market share in the organic and fresh grocery arena as more and more traditional supermarkets have started to stock similar offerings. While Whole Foods did report a three percent rise in total sales for the most recent quarter, sales actually declined 1.8 percent at stores open longer than 12 months.\nWhole Food executives say the drop was likely due to the fewer number of transactions at the stores coupled with aggressive marketing campaigns that offered price reductions on certain popular items. During a conference call earlier this week, the company announced it will continue its price reduction strategy by offering digital coupons within its smartphone app.\nDespite the new price markdowns, a recent survey by BMO Capital Markets revealed that 70 percent of Whole Foods shoppers had not noticed any price reductions in the last three months.\nCritics of the new 365 store concept see the same collision course experienced recently by Walmart. The retail giant launched a line of smaller, convenience-type stores in areas where it didn’t make sense to put a gigantic supercenter. The stores never caught on and the Walmart Express concept eventually imploded.\nThe first 365 store is expected to open in Los Angeles sometime around May, and an additional 10 total stores before the end of next year. In the meantime, millennials can start thinking about the design they want before visiting the Whole Foods tattoo parlor .\n[Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images]"

Does this influence the decision of a buyer or not?\nGreen marketing is the marketing of products that are presumed to be environmentally preferable to others .\nWritten May 12, 2015\nThe other day, I was listening to National Public Radio (NPR), and they were discussing the grocery chain, Whole Foods. Because they offer organic, environmentally conscious, off-brand foods, and spectacular, often locally grown produce their prices are substantially higher than other grocery stores. NPR noted they're often referred to as \"Whole Paycheck.\"\n \nEven so, the stores are usually packed with people from all walks of life, including those with meager paychecks, shopping for fresh goods, which supports their commitment to healthy, often vegetarian or vegan lifestyles.\n \nWith consumers willingness to spend more for products, which support their lifestyles, ethical choices, and preferences, green marketing can be a winning formula in a market crowded with products. Consider the toothpaste aisle. Is Tom's of Maine a better product or simply more desirable because of the quality of their ingredients and philanthropic slant?\n \nDo consumers feel better about using compact fluorescent bulbs because of the quality of the light or energy savings. Is the insurgence of resale shops the result of people having less money or the realization that reusing isn't frowned upon... and you can find cool, lightly used clothing and household items that aren't available in retail.\n \nI would have to say green marketing does influence buyer's behavior!\n174 Views · Answer requested by"
